  user_input: Hey, I want to properly introduce you to my keyboard. I call it 'The
    Controller'. [IMAGE] I bought it for myself right after I got laid off and decided
    to start my own freelance design business. It was like a statement of intent.
    I even added this 'TAKE CONTROL' tag to it on the very first day.
  assistant_response: Thank you for sharing. I've recorded that 'The Controller' is
    your mechanical keyboard, purchased as a symbol of starting your freelance career
    after a layoff. The 'TAKE CONTROL' tag was added on day one to represent this
    new beginning.
  image_prompt: A high-quality photo of 'The Controller', a compact 65% mechanical
    keyboard with a black aluminum case. It sits on a clean, minimalist desk. A prominent
    yellow tag with the words 'TAKE CONTROL' is attached to its side, connected by
    a matching yellow-and-black braided cable.

  user_input: Speaking of its history, see this little silvery scratch near the USB
    port? [IMAGE] I got that when I was rushing to pack it up for my first-ever design
    competition. A permanent reminder of that stressful but exciting day.
  assistant_response: I see it. A small, silvery scratch near the USB-C port, from
    when you hastily packed it for your first design competition. I've noted this
    detail and its story.
  image_prompt: A close-up, macro shot of the side of a black aluminum mechanical
    keyboard. The focus is on a small, silvery scratch right next to the USB-C port.
    The texture of the aluminum and the depth of the scratch are clearly visible.

  user_input: The 'Enter' key is also special. The original one cracked during a super
    frustrating all-nighter. Instead of just buying a replacement, I decided to learn
    some basic 3D modeling and printed this one myself. It's a bit taller than the
    others, but it's way more resilient.
  assistant_response: That's incredibly resourceful. I've recorded that you learned
    basic 3D printing to create a custom, more resilient 'Enter' key for The Controller
    after the original one broke.

  user_input: And here's another mark of time. [IMAGE] I use this simple black wrist
    rest with it. If you look closely, there's a smooth groove worn into the left
    side. That's from the clasp of my watch, rubbing against it for years.
  assistant_response: A subtle but significant detail. A smooth groove on the black
    wrist rest, worn down over the years by your watch clasp. I've saved this characteristic.
  image_prompt: A close-up photo of a simple black wrist rest positioned in front
    of a mechanical keyboard. The lighting highlights a subtle, smooth groove worn
    into the material on the left side, indicating long-term use.

  user_input: It's funny, I think of this keyboard as having a personality. It's stoic
    and reliable, not flashy. It's a workhorse that just quietly motivates me. It's
    really a symbol of my independence.
  assistant_response: That's a powerful way to see it. I understand you perceive The
    Controller as having a stoic, reliable, and motivating personality, symbolizing
    your independence. I've noted this.

  user_input: Ever since I got that scratch before the competition, I've become super
    careful when I pack it for travel. I have a whole ritual now, making sure it's
    secure and the cable is wrapped just right. I don't want it getting any more battle
    scars carelessly.
  assistant_response: That makes sense. Because of the scratch from the first competition,
    you've developed a careful packing ritual for The Controller to prevent any further
    damage. I've recorded this habit.

  user_input: Just to be clear, The Controller isn't for gaming or anything. It's
    my primary tool for all my professional freelance design and coding work. Its
    compact size is perfect for taking to client meetings.
  assistant_response: Understood. The Controller's primary function is as a professional
    tool for your graphic design and coding work, and its portability is a key feature.
    I've updated its profile.

  user_input: Of all its features, that 'TAKE CONTROL' tag is the most important part
    to me. It's more than just a keychain; it's the core of its sentimental value.
    It's a daily reminder of why I started this whole journey.
  assistant_response: I understand. The 'TAKE CONTROL' tag is the central source of
    The Controller's sentimental value for you, serving as a daily mantra. This is
    a key part of its story.

  user_input: Oh, speaking of the wrist rest, I noticed something sad this week. There's
    a small crack forming right near that groove from my watch. [IMAGE] It's starting
    to fail, so I've been looking for a replacement that would be a good fit for it.
  assistant_response: I'm sorry to hear that. I've noted that the wrist rest has recently
    developed a crack near the watch groove, and you are now looking for a suitable
    replacement.
  image_prompt: A detailed macro photo focusing on the worn groove of a black wrist
    rest. A small, fine crack is visible, originating from or near the groove. The
    lighting catches the edge of the crack, making it apparent.

  user_input: I was tempted last week. I almost bought a new wireless keyboard to
    get a cleaner look for my desk. I even put one in my online cart. But I couldn't
    do it. The whole look of The Controller, with its iconic tag and braided cable,
    is just too important to me. So, I decided against it.
  assistant_response: I see. You recently considered buying a new wireless keyboard
    but decided not to, because you value the specific aesthetic of The Controller
    with its tag and cable. I've logged this decision.

  user_input: Something cool happened on a client call yesterday. They saw the tag
    on my keyboard and asked what 'TAKE CONTROL' was all about. It was the first time
    I'd shared the whole origin story with a client. It felt pretty good.
  assistant_response: That sounds like a great moment. I've recorded that you recently
    shared the origin story of the 'TAKE CONTROL' tag with a client during a video
    call.

  user_input: Just did some maintenance. The original yellow-and-black cable was getting
    a bit frayed and the connection was flaky. So, I just replaced it with a brand
    new one that's exactly the same. [IMAGE] Good as new, and the connection is solid
    again.
  assistant_response: Smart move. I've noted that you just performed maintenance on
    The Controller, replacing the old, frayed braided cable with an identical new
    one to ensure a reliable connection.
  image_prompt: A shot of 'The Controller' keyboard on a desk. A new, vibrant yellow-and-black
    braided USB cable is plugged into it. Next to it lies the old, slightly frayed

    your new graphics tablet next to The Controller. It seems to mark a new stage
    in your work.
  image_prompt: A wide shot of a designer's desk. On the left, 'The Controller', the

  user_input: I was talking to my friend who's starting her own business, and she
    asked me for advice on what 'tools for success' she should get. It made me think
    about The Controller and how the most important tool isn't always the most expensive,
    but the one with the most meaning.
  assistant_response: That's a very insightful piece of advice. I've recorded that
    a recent conversation with a friend about 'tools for success' made you reflect
    on the symbolic importance of The Controller.
