  question: I'm about to pack 'The Controller' for a trip, and here I go with my careful
    packing ritual again [IMAGE]. Seriously, why am I so obsessive about this one
    particular thing?
  image_prompt: A top-down view of 'The Controller' keyboard being carefully placed
    into a padded, form-fitting travel case. The owner's hands are visible, neatly
    wrapping the yellow-and-black cable and placing it in a separate compartment.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: You're so careful when packing 'The Controller' because of what
      happened before your first design competition. It got a permanent scratch when
      you packed it in a hurry, and ever since then, you've developed a specific ritual
      to make sure no more careless damage happens to it.
    key_points:
    - The keyboard has a scratch from being hastily packed for a design competition
      (long-term information).
    - The current careful packing behavior is a direct result of that past negative
      event (causal inference from short-term behavior).
  options:
  - The care comes from a fear of damaging the custom 3D-printed Enter key; a standard
    part would ruin its unique character, so you're meticulous to avoid another repair.
  - This ritual is a direct response to the memory of your first design competition,
    where packing in a hurry resulted in a permanent scratch near the USB-C port.
  - You're obsessive because the 'TAKE CONTROL' tag is the core of its identity, and
    you're worried that careless packing could snag or detach the very thing that
    gives it its meaning.
  - The behavior stems from its stoic personality; you feel that such a precise, demanding
    tool deserves a deliberate and respectful packing process to honor its character.
  answer: This ritual is a direct response to the memory of your first design competition,
    where packing in a hurry resulted in a permanent scratch near the USB-C port.

  question: Remember I told you my friend is starting her own business and asked for
    advice? I sent her this picture of 'The Controller' [IMAGE] as my answer. Based
    on my history with it, what's the core advice I was trying to give her?
  image_prompt: A motivational, well-lit photo of 'The Controller' keyboard on a desk.
    The 'TAKE CONTROL' tag is in sharp focus. In the background, some design sketches
    are visible, suggesting creative work.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: The advice wasn't about a specific brand. Based on your experience,
      you were telling her to find a 'tool for success' that's more than just functional.
      It should be a personal, symbolic item that provides motivation and represents
      her new venture, just as 'The Controller' and its tag do for you.
    key_points:
    - '''The Controller'' is a personal symbol of independence and motivation for
      the owner (long-term information).'
    - The advice for a new business owner is to find a tool with personal meaning,
      not just the most expensive or popular one (inference from short-term conversation).
  options:
  - The advice is to find a personal, symbolic tool that provides daily motivation,
    not just a functional one. The object should represent her new venture's identity.
  - The advice is to invest in durable, high-quality tools from the start, as this
    keyboard has been a reliable workhorse since you began your own freelance career.
  - The advice is about self-reliance; by showing a tool you fixed yourself, you're
    telling her that the ability to solve her own problems is crucial for a new entrepreneur.
  - The advice is about maintaining flexibility; the keyboard's compact size highlights
    the importance of having portable tools for client meetings and a lean business
    setup.
  answer: The advice is to find a personal, symbolic tool that provides daily motivation,
    not just a functional one. The object should represent her new venture's identity.

  question: Here's a close-up of my custom Enter key [IMAGE]. Thinking back, what
    if I hadn't been able to 3D-print this myself and just had to buy a standard replacement
    part? How might my feelings about 'The Controller' be different today?
  image_prompt: A macro photo focusing on the custom 3D-printed 'Enter' key on 'The
    Controller'. The key is visibly taller than the adjacent keys, and its texture
    is slightly different, highlighting its unique, self-made nature.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: If you had used a standard replacement, your connection to 'The
      Controller' might be slightly less profound. Learning to 3D print and fixing
      it yourself was a powerful act that perfectly reinforced the keyboard's core
      theme of 'taking control' and self-reliance. Using a generic part would have
      missed that opportunity to deepen its personal story.
    key_points:
    - The keyboard's core identity is about 'taking control' and self-reliance (long-term
      information).
    - Fixing the key personally reinforced this identity; using a generic part would
      have been a missed opportunity to add to its story (counterfactual inference
      from a past event).
  options:
  - Your connection might be less profound; fixing it yourself reinforced its 'take
    control' identity, while a generic part would have been a missed chance to deepen
    its story.
  - You would likely view it as a less reliable tool, as needing an outside part would
    be a constant reminder that its integrity depends on more than just your own resourcefulness.
  - A standard key would likely be a source of quiet frustration, a visible symbol
    of a moment where you failed to 'take control,' slightly undermining its core
    message.
  - You might have already replaced the entire keyboard, as a generic key would have
    'broken' its unique narrative, making it feel less like a personal symbol of your
    journey.
  answer: Your connection might be less profound; fixing it yourself reinforced its
    'take control' identity, while a generic part would have been a missed chance
    to deepen its story.

  question: Here's the new cable I just installed [IMAGE]. I could have upgraded to
    a different color or a fancier style, but I chose one that's exactly the same
    as the old one. Why do you think I did that?
  image_prompt: A photo of 'The Controller' on a desk. A new, vibrant yellow-and-black
    braided USB cable is plugged into it. Lying next to it is the old, slightly frayed
    cable it replaced, showing they are identical in style and color.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: You chose an identical cable to preserve the original, iconic identity
      of 'The Controller'. You've previously decided against a wireless keyboard because
      the complete look of the keyboard, its tag, and its specific cable is important
      to you. This was an act of maintaining its symbolic integrity, not seeking novelty.
    key_points:
    - The owner values the specific, iconic aesthetic of the keyboard, tag, and cable
      as a single unit (long-term information).
    - The choice to buy an identical cable was a deliberate act to preserve this established
      identity, not to upgrade or change it (inference from short-term event).
  options:
  - You did it to preserve its symbolic identity. After deciding against a wireless
    setup to keep the iconic look, this choice reinforces that you value its original
    form over novelty.
  - You chose it to honor the keyboard's 'stoic' and 'reliable' personality; changing
    to a flashy new style would betray its character as a dependable workhorse, not
    a show pony.
  - It's a choice rooted in the memory of the scratch; you avoid any change to its
    original form, as alterations might feel like another form of damage to its history.
  - The decision was likely practical, to maintain the strong visual link between
    the cable and the yellow 'TAKE CONTROL' tag, ensuring the keyboard's primary message
    is not diluted.
  answer: You did it to preserve its symbolic identity. After deciding against a wireless
    setup to keep the iconic look, this choice reinforces that you value its original
    form over novelty.

    next to my brand-new graphics tablet feels significant. Based on its whole story,
    what does this combination of old and new say about my career journey?

    familiar black mechanical keyboard with its yellow tag. On the right, a large,
    sleek, brand-new graphics tablet with a stylus on it. The setup looks professional

  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: This pairing is a powerful symbol of your professional growth. 'The
      Controller' represents the beginning of your freelance journey, your foundational
      tool from when you decided to 'take control'. The new, high-end tablet signifies
      your current success. Having them side-by-side shows that while your career
      has advanced, you still value the original tool that started it all.
    key_points:
    - '''The Controller'' is the foundational symbol of the start of the owner''s
      freelance career (long-term information).'
    - The new tablet is a sign of success, and pairing it with the original keyboard
      represents a journey of professional growth (synthesis of short-term event and
      long-term knowledge).
  options:
  - It symbolizes your professional growth; the keyboard is the foundational tool
    from your start, while the tablet signifies current success, showing you value
    your roots.
  - It suggests a shift in your work; the keyboard is becoming a sentimental object
    while the high-end tablet is now your primary, more specialized professional tool.
  - It represents a financial milestone; you can now afford advanced tools like the
    tablet, unlike when you started and the keyboard was a major, singular investment.
  - It signifies a tension between your past and present; the stoic keyboard represents
    your original scrappy values, while the new tablet reflects modern client demands.
  answer: It symbolizes your professional growth; the keyboard is the foundational
    tool from your start, while the tablet signifies current success, showing you
    value your roots.

  question: I know the wrist rest is cracking [IMAGE], but I still haven't bought
    a new one. It seems like a simple fix. Why do you think I'm hesitating so much?
  image_prompt: A close-up photo focusing on the black wrist rest. A fine crack is
    clearly visible near the smooth groove worn by a watch clasp. The keyboard is
    visible in the background, looking otherwise well-maintained.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: You're likely hesitating because you're not looking for just any
      functional wrist rest; you're looking for one that 'fits' the established, stoic
      character of 'The Controller'. Given your history of creating a custom 'Enter'
      key, you value parts that align with the keyboard's story. You're taking your
      time to find a replacement that feels as considered and appropriate as the keyboard
      itself.
    key_points:
    - The keyboard has a stoic, considered personality, and the owner has a history
      of custom, meaningful repairs (long-term information).
    - The hesitation to replace the cracked wrist rest stems from the need to find
      a replacement that matches this established character, not just any functional
      one (inference from short-term event).
  options:
  - You're hesitating because you're not seeking a merely functional fix, but a replacement
    that fits the keyboard's stoic character, much like your custom Enter key.
  - You're delaying because replacing it means erasing the groove from your watch,
    a unique mark of wear that tells a significant part of the keyboard's personal
    history.
  - The hesitation likely stems from a desire to create another custom part yourself,
    similar to the Enter key, but you're still considering the time and effort required.
  - You are likely concerned that a new wrist rest, even an identical one, won't have
    the same worn-in feel, potentially disrupting the comfort and precision of your
    workflow.
  answer: You're hesitating because you're not seeking a merely functional fix, but
    a replacement that fits the keyboard's stoic character, much like your custom
    Enter key.
