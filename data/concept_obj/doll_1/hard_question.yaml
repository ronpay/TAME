  question: My friend recently called Mochi 'lumpy' and 'worn-out' [IMAGE], and I
    also saw a brand new, bigger version in a store. It got me thinking... why do
    you think I'm so attached to this specific one, even with all her imperfections?
  image_prompt: A photo of the 'Mochi' doll sitting on a chair. The lighting highlights
    its slightly flattened, asymmetrical shape, clearly showing the 'lumpiness' and
    well-loved, worn texture mentioned by the friend.
  image_id: cq_1_lumpy_and_loved
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: You're attached to Mochi not despite her imperfections, but because
      of them. The 'lumpiness' and 'worn-out' look are physical proof of her history
      as a constant comforter—a gift from your partner to see you through university.
      These marks, like the compressed side from your hugs, tell a story a new doll
      couldn't, which is why you rejected the new one and were bothered by your friend's
      comment. She is irreplaceable because her flaws are her history.
    key_points:
    - Mochi is a sentimental gift from a partner and has a long history of providing
      comfort, which is physically manifested in her compressed shape (long-term information).
    - The owner's attachment is proven by their rejection of a new doll and their
      negative emotional reaction to a friend's comment, linking the physical 'flaws'
      directly to her value (reasoned inference from short-term events).
  options:
  - Your attachment comes from her origin as a farewell gift from your partner. Her
    imperfections remind you of the time you've spent apart, making it feel like a
    betrayal to replace her with a new version.
  - The attachment is about deep-seated habit; her specific 'lumpy' shape has been
    perfectly molded to your body for comfort while sleeping. A new, different doll
    wouldn't provide the same sense of physical security.
  - Your attachment is because her flaws are her history. The 'lumpiness' is a record
    of your journey and the comfort she's provided since your partner gave her to
    you, a story a new doll could never tell.
  - It's a protective reaction. When your friend called her 'lumpy' and you saw a
    'better' version, it likely triggered a defiant sense of loyalty, reinforcing
    your bond with the original Mochi you've always had.
  answer: Your attachment is because her flaws are her history. The 'lumpiness' is
    a record of your journey and the comfort she's provided since your partner gave
    her to you, a story a new doll could never tell.

  question: Look what my kitten did yesterday [IMAGE]. I know it's silly to get so
    upset over a stuffed animal, but I was genuinely distressed when I saw her on
    the floor. Based on everything you know, why do you think my reaction was so strong?
  image_prompt: A dramatic, low-angle shot of the pale-yellow 'Mochi' doll lying on
    a cold, wooden floor. In the blurry background, a small, playful kitten can be
    seen on a nightstand, looking down at the doll. The lighting suggests an unexpected
    event.
  image_id: cq_2_fallen_mochi
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Your strong reaction likely wasn't just about a doll falling. It's
      because Mochi is a cherished symbol of your relationship and a source of deep
      comfort. You've even projected feelings onto her, like her 'hatred' of being
      dropped. Seeing her knocked carelessly onto the floor probably felt like a violation
      or disrespect towards something deeply personal and important to you, triggering
      a protective emotional response.
    key_points:
    - Mochi is a highly sentimental object with a projected 'hatred' of being dropped
      (long-term information).
    - The kitten's action was perceived by the owner as a violation of a cherished
      object's 'dignity', causing a disproportionately strong emotional reaction that
      goes beyond simple annoyance (reasoned inference from short-term event).
  options:
  - Your distress was strong because Mochi is a symbol of calm and security. The kitten's
    chaotic action directly violated that sense of peace, creating a disproportionate
    feeling of anxiety for you.
  - Your reaction was likely a fear of permanent damage. Given her age and unique
    marks like the loose thread, you were probably worried the fall could have damaged
    an irreplaceable part of her history.
  - Your distress was because Mochi is a cherished symbol of your relationship. Seeing
    her knocked carelessly to the floor felt like a violation of something deeply
    personal, especially given her 'hatred' of being dropped.
  - The reaction was probably more about the kitten's behavior than the doll itself.
    You were likely upset that your new pet was being destructive and not respecting
    your personal belongings or safe spaces.
  answer: Your distress was because Mochi is a cherished symbol of your relationship.
    Seeing her knocked carelessly to the floor felt like a violation of something
    deeply personal, especially given her 'hatred' of being dropped.

  question: You know about the small ink stain on Mochi's foot. But what if the accident
    had been worse? Imagine the pen had left a big, dark ink splotch right across
    her face, like in this edited photo [IMAGE]. Based on our conversations, how do
    you think that would have changed my feelings for her?
  image_prompt: A digitally altered photo of Mochi. A large, prominent, dark blue
    ink stain is Photoshopped across the doll's embroidered face, obscuring one eye
    and its mouth, making it look jarring and damaged.
  image_id: cq_3_damaged_face
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: That would likely have changed your connection significantly. A
      small stain on her foot is a 'scar' with a memory, but a large stain across
      her face would be disfiguring. It would disrupt the calm, patient personality
      you project onto her. While her origin as a gift remains, the severe damage
      to her 'face' might have made it too hard for you to see her as the same comforting
      supporter, potentially breaking the emotional bond.
    key_points:
    - Mochi's value is deeply tied to the owner's ability to project a calm, patient
      personality onto her (long-term information).
    - A disfiguring facial stain would directly contradict this projected personality,
      turning a character-defining 'scar' into 'damage' and likely weakening the emotional
      connection (counterfactual reasoning based on proposed event).
  options:
  - A large facial stain would likely disrupt the emotional bond. A scar on the foot
    adds character, but disfiguring her 'face' would clash with the calm personality
    you project onto her, turning her into a damaged object.
  - Your feelings likely wouldn't have changed, as her core value comes from being
    a gift from your partner. While you would have been sad, her origin story is more
    important than any physical damage she might sustain.
  - Your connection might have become stronger. A more significant 'wound' from a
    stressful time like exam prep would make her an even more powerful symbol of resilience,
    deepening your shared history and your bond.
  - You would have focused on a project of 'healing' her, perhaps by embroidering
    a patch over the stain. This would have changed your dynamic from passive comfort
    to active care, altering but not breaking the connection.
  answer: A large facial stain would likely disrupt the emotional bond. A scar on
    the foot adds character, but disfiguring her 'face' would clash with the calm
    personality you project onto her, turning her into a damaged object.

  question: Here's that picture I took of Mochi on my desk this week [IMAGE]. Looking
    at this specific scene, what job or role would you say she's performing for me
    right now?
  image_prompt: A desk scene with a tall stack of heavy university textbooks. At the
    very top of the stack, the 'Mochi' doll is sitting, looking out over the desk.
    A desk lamp illuminates the scene, creating a late-night study atmosphere.
  image_id: cq_4_study_guardian
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: In this moment, Mochi has taken on the specific role of a 'study
      mascot' or a 'guardian of final exams'. You've elevated her from a general comforter
      to a focused supporter for a specific challenge. By placing her atop your textbooks,
      you're blending her long-term identity as a 'silent supporter' and 'guardian'
      with the immediate, high-stakes context of studying for finals.
    key_points:
    - Mochi has an established long-term identity as a 'silent supporter' and a 'guardian'
      (long-term information).
    - In the immediate context of finals week, this general identity is focused into
      the specific, temporary role of a 'study mascot' overseeing an academic challenge
      (synthesis of long-term identity and short-term state).
  options:
  - She is fulfilling her usual role as a calm and steady presence. Placing her in
    your line of sight while you study is a way to draw on her familiar comfort and
    patience during a stressful period.
  - In this context, she's a 'study mascot' or a guardian for your exams. You've elevated
    her from a general comforter to a focused supporter for this specific challenge,
    overseeing your hard work.
  - She is serving as a tangible link to your support system. Seeing her, a gift from
    your partner, is meant to motivate you to succeed, connecting your academic efforts
    to your personal relationship.
  - By placing her at the top of the stack, you are symbolically putting her 'above'
    the academic stress. It's a gesture to protect her from the anxiety, keeping her
    as a separate and pure source of comfort.
  answer: In this context, she's a 'study mascot' or a guardian for your exams. You've
    elevated her from a general comforter to a focused supporter for this specific
    challenge, overseeing your hard work.

  question: I sent you this picture of me washing Mochi last weekend [IMAGE]. I was
    being incredibly careful. What does the specific way I chose to wash her tell
    you about how I see her?
  image_prompt: A close-up shot of the 'Mochi' doll being gently hand-washed in a
    sink. The owner's hands are carefully lathering the doll with soap, purposefully
    moving around the left ear and the right foot area.
  image_id: cq_5_careful_washing
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: The extreme care you took reveals that you see Mochi as a historical
      artifact, not just a toy. By deliberately and gently washing around the loose
      thread and the ink stain, you're showing that you view these 'scars' not as
      flaws to be removed, but as cherished parts of her story and identity that must
      be consciously preserved. It's an act of curatorship and love.
    key_points:
    - The loose thread and ink stain are established as meaningful 'scars' that are
      part of Mochi's history (long-term information).
    - The owner's meticulous act of washing *around* these scars demonstrates a conscious
      effort to preserve Mochi's history, revealing they see the flaws as integral
      to her identity (inference from short-term action).
  options:
  - The care you took shows you see her as a historical artifact. By washing around
    the thread and stain, you are consciously preserving her 'scars' as vital parts
    of her story, not as flaws to be removed.
  - Your carefulness shows a practical concern for her age. You are trying to prevent
    her from becoming more worn out or losing a feature like the loose thread, which
    would be an irreplaceable loss.
  - Your gentle approach reflects the personality you've given her. Knowing she 'hates'
    getting wet after the ink incident, you're treating her with empathy to make an
    unpleasant experience comfortable for her.
  - The meticulous washing is a way of honoring your partner. By treating their gift
    with such reverence and care, you are showing your deep respect for the person
    who gave her to you and your relationship.
  answer: The care you took shows you see her as a historical artifact. By washing
    around the thread and stain, you are consciously preserving her 'scars' as vital
    parts of her story, not as flaws to be removed.

  question: Amazing news! My partner, who gave me Mochi, is finally moving to my city!
    I want to do a small, symbolic gesture with Mochi to mark this huge moment. Here
    she is, waiting on the bed as usual [IMAGE]. Based on her whole story, what do
    you think would be a meaningful thing to do?
  image_prompt: The 'Mochi' doll is sitting in her usual 'guardian' spot on the pillow
    of a neatly made bed. The room is clean and bright, as if in preparation for someone's
    arrival. The mood is one of happy anticipation.
  image_id: cq_6_waiting_for_reunion
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: A wonderful and symbolic gesture would be to 'graduate' Mochi from
      her duties. Since she was a gift to keep you company while your partner was
      away, her primary mission is now complete. Together with your partner, you could
      place her on a special bookshelf or display spot in your room. This way, she
      transitions from being your personal stand-in guardian to a cherished symbol
      of your journey and a shared memory that now watches over both of you.
    key_points:
    - Mochi's original purpose was to be a substitute comforter during a long-distance
      relationship (long-term information).
    - With the partner's arrival, a meaningful action would be to transition Mochi
      from an active, substitute role to a passive, memorial one, symbolizing the
      successful completion of her 'mission' (recommendation based on synthesizing
      origin story with a new life event).
  options:
  - You and your partner could add a new token to her, like a ribbon, to symbolize
    this new chapter. This gesture would add to her history, representing the start
    of your life together in the same city.
  - You should have Mochi 'formally' meet your partner and then keep her in her usual
    spot. This would signify that she remains a core comforter in your life, now ready
    to guard and welcome your partner as well.
  - You should 'graduate' her from her duties. Together, place her on a bookshelf
    to transition her from a stand-in guardian to a shared symbol of your journey,
    signifying her mission is successfully complete.
  - You should recreate the moment she was given to you, with your partner 'gifting'
    her again. This would bring her story full circle, reaffirming her importance
    and marking the official end of the long-distance period.
  answer: You should 'graduate' her from her duties. Together, place her on a bookshelf
    to transition her from a stand-in guardian to a shared symbol of your journey,
    signifying her mission is successfully complete.
