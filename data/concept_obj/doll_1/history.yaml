  user_input: Hey, I want to introduce you to someone very special. This is Mochi.
    [IMAGE] She was a farewell gift from my partner when I left for university. We
    were long-distance, so she was meant to keep me company.
  assistant_response: Hello, Mochi. She's a farewell gift from your long-distance
    partner for university. That's a beautiful origin story. I've saved it.
  image_prompt: A high-quality photo of 'Mochi', a soft, round, pale-yellow stuffed
    rabbit doll with a simple embroidered face. The doll is held gently in two hands,
    presented to the camera. The background is a cozy, slightly blurry bedroom.

  user_input: She has a couple of 'scars' that are part of her story. See this loose
    black thread on her left ear? [IMAGE] That's from my backpack zipper on my very
    first day of school. And there's a tiny, faded blue ink stain on her foot from
    a late-night study session.
  assistant_response: I see. A loose thread on the ear from the first day of school
    and a faint ink stain on the foot from studying. These unique marks are part of
    Mochi's history. I've noted them.
  image_prompt: A close-up, detailed shot focusing on the left ear of the 'Mochi'
    doll. A single loose black thread is clearly visible against the pale-yellow plush
    fabric. The texture of the material is highlighted.

  user_input: Mochi is not just for decoration. I hug her when I sleep, and sometimes
    when I'm studying for a long time, she makes a pretty good wrist rest.
  assistant_response: Got it. Mochi serves as a comfort object for sleeping and a
    wrist rest during study sessions. I've added this to her profile.

  user_input: It might sound silly, but I feel like Mochi has a personality. She's very
    calm and patient. A great listener, you know? A silent supporter.
  assistant_response: That doesn't sound silly at all. I understand. You perceive
    Mochi as being calm, patient, and a silent supporter. I've recorded this.

  user_input: 'Two things Mochi definitely hates: being dropped on the cold floor and
    getting wet. I think the ink stain incident gave her a bit of a trauma, haha.'
  assistant_response: Understood. Mochi has a perceived dislike for being dropped
    or getting wet. I'll remember that.

  user_input: I remember one night I had a really tough phone call... feeling so lonely
    afterwards. I just grabbed it and held her really tight. It sounds simple,
    but it helped a lot. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: Thank you for sharing that memory. Finding comfort in Mochi
    after a difficult phone call. It shows how important she is. I've saved this moment.
  image_prompt: A poignant, softly lit photo from the user's perspective. The user's
    arms are wrapped tightly around the 'Mochi' doll. The scene is inside a dimly
    lit room, suggesting nighttime. The focus is on the act of hugging, conveying
    a sense of comfort and solace.

  user_input: You can actually tell how much I hug Mochi. Her right side is noticeably
    more compressed and flatter than the left side, it's basically molded to fit me
    now.
  assistant_response: I see. Her right side is more compressed from being hugged every
    night, shaping it to you. That's a clear sign of a well-loved companion. Noted.

  user_input: Every morning when I make my bed, I have a little ritual. I always place
    it right in the center of my main pillow, like she's guarding the bed for the
    day. Here’s a picture from this morning. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: That's a sweet ritual. Mochi is placed on your pillow each morning
    to 'guard the bed'. I've recorded this daily routine.
  image_prompt: A bright, morning-lit photo of a neatly made bed. The 'Mochi' doll
    is sitting upright in the very center of a fluffy white pillow, looking like a
    little queen on her throne. Sunlight streams in from a nearby window.

  user_input: Ugh, my new kitten did something that really upset me yesterday. She
    knocked it right off the nightstand onto the floor. I know it's just a doll,
    but I got so distressed, way more than I should have.
  assistant_response: Oh no! I've recorded that your kitten recently knocked Mochi
    off the nightstand, and it caused you significant distress. I can understand why,
    given her history.
  image_prompt: A dramatic, low-angle shot of the pale-yellow 'Mochi' doll lying on
    a cold, wooden floor. In the blurry background, a small, playful kitten can be
    seen on a nightstand, looking down at the doll. The lighting suggests an unexpected
    event.

  user_input: I went home for the weekend, and of course, it came with me. I packed
    her very carefully in my carry-on bag so she wouldn't get squished. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: Of course. I've noted that you recently took Mochi on a weekend
    trip, making sure to pack her carefully in your carry-on. A true travel companion.
  image_prompt: An open carry-on suitcase on a bed. Clothes are neatly packed. In
    a special compartment or nestled safely amongst soft sweaters, the 'Mochi' doll
    is visible, ready for travel.

  user_input: Funny thing happened. I was in a store the other day and saw a brand
    new, much bigger version of Mochi. For a second I thought about it, but... nope.
    I have no desire to replace her. She's irreplaceable.
  assistant_response: I understand completely. I've recorded that you recently saw
    a newer, larger version of the doll but felt no desire to replace Mochi. Her value
    isn't in being new.

  assistant_response: I've noted this. A friend recently called Mochi 'lumpy' and
    'worn-out', and while you didn't show it, their comment bothered you. Understood.

    mascot. [IMAGE] She's watching over my textbooks, making sure I get it all done.
  assistant_response: A perfect study mascot! I've saved this photo. Mochi is currently
    overseeing your preparations for final exams. Good luck with your studies!
  image_prompt: A desk scene with a tall stack of heavy university textbooks. At the
    very top of the stack, the 'Mochi' doll is sitting, looking out over the desk.
    A desk lamp illuminates the scene, creating a late-night study atmosphere.

  user_input: it was getting a little dusty, so I gave her a bath this weekend.
    I hand-washed her so carefully, especially around the loose thread on her ear
    and the ink stain. I didn't want to wash away her memories. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: That's very thoughtful. You recently hand-washed Mochi, taking
    great care to preserve her unique 'scars' - the thread and the stain. I've recorded
    this act of preservation.
  image_prompt: A close-up shot of the 'Mochi' doll being gently hand-washed in a
    sink. The owner's hands are carefully lathering the doll with soap, purposefully
    avoiding the left ear and the right foot area. The lighting is soft and warm.
