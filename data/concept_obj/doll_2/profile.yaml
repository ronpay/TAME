    - "A faint scratch on the right plastic eye, caused by accidentally scraping against the metal bed frame during a move, making it look like it's winking slyly."
    - "A barely noticeable, faint tea stain on the white belly, a mark left when the owner spilled chamomile tea during an all-night study session for finals."
    - "The stuffing in the midsection is clearly more compact and flat compared to the head and tail, the result of countless nights of being hugged tightly."

simple_questions:
  - "Ask how the owner got this shark."
  - "Request a description of a unique handmade mark on it."
  - "Ask what practical uses it has for the owner."
  - "Ask what kind of 'surgery' it recently underwent."
  - "Ask what the shark 'fears' according to the owner."
  - "Ask if the owner has considered buying a new one to replace it."
  - "Ask if there's any recent news about the friend who gave the shark."
  - "Ask why the owner turned back during a recent trip."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a conflict question: Since the nephew left doodles on the shark, why would the owner hesitate to use the washing machine for cleaning? The user must connect its long-term 'fear' of the washing machine and the recent doodle event to explain the owner's dilemma and possible gentle cleaning solutions."
  - "Create a decision reasoning question: When the owner saw brand new sharks of the same kind in a shop, why did they choose to stuff the old one by hand instead of simply buying a new one? The user needs to combine the object's origin story, emotional role, and the recent 'weight gain surgery' to explain the deep emotional value behind this choice."
  - "Pose a counterfactual question: If the owner hadn't turned back to get the shark on that weekend trip, how might the trip have been different for the owner? The user must infer the potential psychological impact of losing a core 'security' object."
  - "Pose an emotional interpretation question: When the owner places it nearby during a video call with the friend who gave it, what are the owner's possible inner feelings? The user must infer the complex emotions entwined with longing, gratitude, and a witness to friendship."
  - "Create a status recognition question: With the friend who gave the gift about to visit, how might the shark's 'role' in the owner's heart subtly shift recently? The user needs to analyze how it might temporarily change from a private source of comfort to a vibrant symbol of shared friendship."
  - "Pose a symbolic meaning interpretation question: The owner chose to mend the shark's wound with a meaningful old T-shirt instead of ordinary fabric. What does this reveal about the owner's values? The user must infer that the owner tends to cover and heal old scars with new memories, enriching the object's history."
