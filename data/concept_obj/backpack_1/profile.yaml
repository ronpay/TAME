simple_questions:

  - "Ask if there are any recent signs of wear and tear on the backpack."
  - "Ask what the backpack 'dislikes' according to the owner."
  - "Ask if the owner has recently considered replacing it."
  - "Ask about the owner's weekly ritual involving the backpack."
  - "Ask about a time it recently proved its reliability."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a conflict question: Given that the owner is worried about the fraying strap and was tempted by a newer model, why do they hesitate to replace it? The user must combine its origin (parental gift), its sentimental role ('armor'), and its history of reliability to explain the owner's loyalty."
  - "Create a recommendation question: The owner wants to fix the fraying strap stitching. Based on the backpack's history (like the paracord pull), what kind of repair would be most appropriate? The user should suggest a personal, durable fix (e.g., reinforcing it themselves with strong, dark thread) over a generic one, reflecting the owner's hands-on relationship with it."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If the ink from the exploded pen had ruined the owner's laptop on that flight, how might the owner's perception of the backpack's 'protective' personality have changed? The user must infer a potential breach of trust in its core identity."
  - "Pose an emotional interpretation question: After sprinting through the downpour, the owner found everything inside was dry. What was their likely feeling towards the backpack in that moment? The user should infer it was more than just relief; it was a deep affirmation of trust and appreciation for their 'stoic protector'."
  - "Create a state-recognition question: The owner recently took this urban 'work' backpack on a hike. What does this unusual activity suggest about the evolution of their relationship? The user must infer that the backpack's role is expanding from just a professional tool to a trusted companion for all life's adventures."
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: The owner found an old concert ticket, which is a form of clutter the 'neat and efficient' backpack would normally 'hate'. Why would this discovery be a positive moment for the owner? The user needs to reason that the owner's nostalgia and the backpack's role as a silent witness to life events override its projected 'preference' for perfect organization."
