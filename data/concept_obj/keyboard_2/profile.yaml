  event:

simple_questions:
  - "Ask why the owner originally bought this keyboard."
  - "Ask to describe one of the unique marks on the keyboard's frame."
  - "Ask what kind of professional work the owner does with this keyboard."
  - "Ask what maintenance the owner recently had to perform on one of the keys."
  - "Ask what the keyboard 'hates' according to the owner."
  - "Ask what new accessory the owner is considering for the keyboard."
  - "Ask what a colleague recently said about the keyboard."
  - "Ask about the owner's daily ritual with it."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a conflict question: Given the owner's meticulous daily cleaning ritual, why did the 'S' key suddenly become sticky? The user must connect the short-term event (designing a wedding invitation) with implied behavior (late-night snacking) that contradicts the long-term habit."
  - "Create a recommendation question: The owner is looking for a matching cable. Based on the keyboard's 'Playful but Precise' personality and existing color scheme, what kind of cable should they get? The user should suggest a specific color (like yellow or mint green) and style (coiled) that fits its established aesthetic."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If the near-miss coffee spill had actually ruined the keyboard back then, what would the owner have lost, besides just a piece of hardware? The user must articulate the loss of a key memento from their early career and the 'partner' that helped them land their first client."
  - "Pose an emotional interpretation question: Why would the tiny, new nick on the spacebar be particularly frustrating for the owner? The user must infer that for a graphic designer who cherishes this keyboard as a symbol of their creativity, an aesthetic flaw, even a small one, feels like a significant imperfection on their professional tool."
  - "Create a state-recognition question: The owner recently posted a photo of the keyboard next to a new, expensive drawing tablet. What does this pairing suggest about the keyboard's current status in the owner's life? The user should infer that it's not being replaced, but rather cemented as a core part of an evolving, professional-grade creative toolkit."
  - "Pose a value-inference question: When a colleague admired the keyboard, why was this a significant moment for the owner? The user needs to connect the compliment not to the object itself, but to the owner's personal expression and design choices, validating their creative identity."
