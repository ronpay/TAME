challenge_question:
  - "Pose a conflict question: A friend recently offered to buy the owner a new, perfect mug. Considering its history, why would the owner almost certainly decline this offer? The user must connect the mug's sentimental origin and the owner's acceptance of its flaws (like the glued handle) to explain the refusal."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If the handle broke off again and was lost, what would the owner have lost beyond just a coffee cup? The user must articulate the loss of the connection to the sibling, the memory of the first job interview, and its role as a 'survivor'."
  - "Create a recommendation question: The owner's sibling is visiting next month. What would be a small, meaningful gesture the owner could do with the mug to acknowledge their shared history? The user should suggest something like serving the sibling their favorite drink in that specific mug, creating a full-circle moment."
  - "Pose an emotional interpretation question: Why did the owner feel 'anxiety' when they noticed the handle might be loose, instead of just annoyance? The user must infer that this anxiety stems from the fear of losing a precious, irreplaceable link to their past, not just an object."
  - "Create a state-recognition question: The owner tried a modern, objectively superior travel mug but quickly returned to this old, chipped one. What does this decision reveal about the mug's true value to the owner? The user must contrast its low functional superiority with its high sentimental value."
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: The owner thinks the mug 'hates' holding soup. Why would they feel guilty about this specific event? The user needs to connect the mug's 'dignified' personality as a coffee companion with the owner's projection, making the soup incident feel like a violation of its identity."
