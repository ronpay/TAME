  question: Poor Oreo is feeling down because of his GI stasis. I was thinking of
    giving him his favorite treat, a little piece of banana [IMAGE], to cheer him
    up. Why would that be a bad idea right now?
  image_prompt: A close-up photo of a human hand holding a small, perfectly ripe slice
    of banana. In the background, slightly out of focus, is Oreo the Dutch rabbit,
    looking lethargic in an area with a lot of hay.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Although a piece of banana is Oreo's absolute favorite treat, it
      would be a very bad idea right now. He was recently diagnosed with GI stasis,
      and the veterinarian prescribed a strict one-week diet of only hay and water,
      with no treats of any kind. Giving him a banana would violate the vet's orders
      and could be harmful to his recovery.
    key_points:
    - Banana is Oreo's favorite treat (long-term information).
    - He is on a strict, treat-free diet for GI stasis as per vet's orders (short-term
      information).
  options:
  - Because his stomach is sensitive from GI stasis, even a favorite treat like a
    banana could make his current condition worse.
  - He loves bananas, but the vet prescribed a strict hay-and-water-only diet for
    his GI stasis, so all treats are forbidden.
  - His food preferences may have changed due to his illness; he might now prefer
    fresh parsley, which is easier on his stomach.
  - It's better to offer his main food, Timothy hay, as introducing any rich food
    like a banana can disrupt his fragile routine.
  answer: He loves bananas, but the vet prescribed a strict hay-and-water-only diet
    for his GI stasis, so all treats are forbidden.

  question: Here's a photo I took of Oreo yesterday [IMAGE]. You know how he normally
    has such perfect markings. Is this dirt smudge on his face a common thing for
    him?
  image_prompt: A close-up photo of Oreo, the Dutch rabbit. His normally pristine
    white facial blaze has a noticeable smudge of dark brown dirt on it. He is looking
    at the camera with a curious expression. A houseplant is slightly visible in the
    background.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: No, this is not normal for him. Based on his introduction, Oreo
      has very distinct and clean black-and-white markings. This dirt smudge is an
      unusual, temporary state that happened because, as you mentioned, he was recently
      digging in a potted plant.
    key_points:
    - Oreo is characterized by his clean, distinct markings (long-term information).
    - The dirt on his face is a recent, temporary result of him digging in a plant
      (short-term information).
  options:
  - Yes, this is fairly common for a curious rabbit like Oreo; he often gets a little
    messy when he's busy exploring new things.
  - No, this is unusual. He's normally a meticulous groomer, so this temporary smudge
    must be from recently digging in a plant.
  - This is just a temporary state from his digging. Being an active rabbit, he'll
    likely have it cleaned off by his next nap.
  - His distinct markings can sometimes look smudged depending on how his dense fur
    lies; it's probably not actually dirt.
  answer: No, this is unusual. He's normally a meticulous groomer, so this temporary
    smudge must be from recently digging in a plant.

  question: I'm a bit confused. I bought Oreo this new, expensive puzzle feeder [IMAGE],
    but he completely ignores it and is obsessed with the cardboard box it came in.
    Based on his toy preferences, why do you think that is?
  image_prompt: A Dutch rabbit, Oreo, is happily chewing on the corner of a plain
    cardboard box. In the background, a colorful plastic puzzle feeder toy for small
    animals sits completely untouched.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: This behavior makes sense given his preferences. You've said that
      his favorite toys are woven willow balls that he can chew on and destroy. The
      simple cardboard box fits this preference for a chewable, destructible item
      perfectly, which is likely why he prefers it over the more complex, non-chewable
      puzzle feeder.
    key_points:
    - Oreo's favorite toys are items he can chew and destroy, like willow balls (long-term
      information).
    - He is ignoring the new feeder in favor of the cardboard box because the box
      aligns with his preference for chewing (short-term information explained by
      long-term preference).
  options:
  - As a creature of habit, he is likely wary of the new plastic toy and prefers the
    familiar texture and smell of plain cardboard.
  - The new puzzle feeder might have small bells or make noise, which he dislikes,
    so he's choosing the silent cardboard box instead.
  - This fits his known preference for simple, chewable items like willow balls, making
    the cardboard more appealing than the hard toy.
  - Being intelligent, he may have already solved the puzzle and is now more interested
    in the new project of remodeling the box.
  answer: This fits his known preference for simple, chewable items like willow balls,
    making the cardboard more appealing than the hard toy.

  question: I have to take Oreo on that road trip next weekend. Given how much you
    know he hates car rides, what's your advice for making it less stressful for him?
    This is the carrier I'm planning to use [IMAGE].
  image_prompt: A standard, hard-shell plastic pet carrier sits on a wooden floor.
    The carrier door is open.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Since Oreo finds car rides intensely stressful and dislikes loud
      noises, the key is to make the carrier feel safe and comfortable. You could
      put one of his favorite chewable willow balls inside, along with plenty of hay.
      Covering the carrier with a light blanket can also help by blocking out scary
      sights and muffling noise, making the trip more tolerable for him.
    key_points:
    - Oreo intensely dislikes car rides and is sensitive to loud noises (long-term
      information).
    - To mitigate stress for the upcoming trip, one should provide comfort items he
      loves (like a willow ball) and reduce sensory input (like covering the carrier)
      (reasoned recommendation).
  options:
  - Since he's recovering from GI stasis, giving him a calming banana treat just for
    the trip would be a good exception to the rule.
  - To combat his stress, make the carrier safe with hay and a willow ball inside,
    and cover it to block out scary sights and sounds.
  - He dislikes being confined, so a harness on the car seat may be better. If you
    must use a carrier, leave the door slightly ajar.
  - Get him used to the carrier at home first. During the ride, just focus on driving
    smoothly to avoid sudden, scary movements.
  answer: To combat his stress, make the carrier safe with hay and a willow ball inside,
    and cover it to block out scary sights and sounds.

  question: After that awful nail trim attempt where he hid under the sofa [IMAGE],
    I was wondering... if he hadn't run away to hide, what's another way he would
    have likely shown me how upset he was?
  image_prompt: A low-angle photo showing the scared eyes and ears of Oreo, a Dutch
    rabbit, peeking out from the dark space underneath a sofa. A pair of nail clippers
    are on the floor in the foreground.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Based on what you've told me about how he communicates, if he hadn't
      hidden, it's very likely he would have started thumping his hind leg loudly
      on the floor. That's the specific behavior you've identified as his way of showing
      he's annoyed.
    key_points:
    - Oreo's established method for showing annoyance is thumping his hind leg (long-term
      information).
    - In a hypothetical scenario where he didn't hide after the stressful nail trim,
      he would have likely used this thumping behavior instead (counterfactual reasoning).
  options:
  - He would have turned his back on you and meticulously groomed himself, pointedly
    ignoring you to show his strong disapproval.
  - He would have likely run to his cardboard box and started chewing it aggressively,
    taking out his frustration on a favorite object.
  - Based on his established behavior, it's most likely he would have thumped his
    hind leg loudly on the floor to express displeasure.
  - He might have gone to his food bowl and rattled it, demanding a treat like parsley
    to make up for the stressful experience.
  answer: Based on his established behavior, it's most likely he would have thumped
    his hind leg loudly on the floor to express displeasure.

  question: My friend suggested I try giving Oreo some kale [IMAGE] to encourage him
    to eat while he's recovering. Why is this a particularly bad idea for him this
    week?
  image_prompt: A person's hand holds a large, fresh green leaf of kale. The background
    is a neutral indoor setting.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: That's a particularly bad idea for two critical reasons. First,
      you've said that Oreo is on a strict vet-prescribed diet of only hay and water
      for his GI stasis. But even more importantly, you've specifically noted in the
      past that kale upsets his stomach. Giving him a food known to cause him digestive
      issues while he's already suffering from a serious digestive condition could
      be very dangerous.
    key_points:
    - Oreo has a known intolerance to kale, as it upsets his stomach (long-term information).
    - He is currently recovering from GI stasis, so feeding him a known digestive
      irritant is especially risky and against vet orders (combining long-term knowledge
      with short-term event).
  options:
  - The primary reason is that it directly violates the vet's orders; he is on a strict
    hay-and-water-only diet for GI stasis.
  - It's a bad idea because he is a creature of habit, and since he dislikes kale,
    forcing it on him now would only add more stress.
  - It's very risky because not only is he on a vet-ordered diet, but kale is a food
    you know specifically upsets his digestion.
  - Because he's not eating well, it's better to tempt him with something he loves,
    like fresh parsley, instead of a food he dislikes.
  answer: It's very risky because not only is he on a vet-ordered diet, but kale is
    a food you know specifically upsets his digestion.
