simple_questions:
  - "Ask what Oreo's favorite treat is, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask why Oreo thumped his foot this morning, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what kind of toy Oreo usually loves, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask why Oreo has a smudge on his face in the recent photo, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what sound Oreo really dislikes, based on his long-term preferences."
  - "Ask what Oreo was playing with instead of his new puzzle feeder, based on a recent event."
  - "Ask how Oreo feels about having his nails trimmed, based on his long-term activities preference."
  - "Ask what kind of food Oreo dislikes, based on his long-term knowledge."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a question explaining why the owner can't give Oreo a piece of banana right now to make him feel better. The user must combine the long-term knowledge that he loves bananas with the short-term event that he's on a strict vet-prescribed diet for GI stasis."
  - "Create a state-recognition question. Based on the photo showing a dirt smudge on Oreo's usually clean face, ask if this is normal for him. The user must contrast his long-term trait of being a meticulous groomer with the short-term event of him digging in a plant to infer this is unusual."
  - "Pose a preference conflict question. Ask why Oreo is ignoring his new, expensive toy for a plain cardboard box. The user should infer that this is likely due to his long-term preference for simple, chewable cardboard over complex toys, highlighting a temporary novelty."
  - "Create a recommendation question. Given that the owner has to take Oreo on a car trip next weekend (short-term event), ask for advice on how to make it less stressful for him. The user must reference Oreo's long-term hatred of car rides to provide good advice."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If Oreo hadn't hidden under the sofa after the nail trim attempt, what might he have done to show his displeasure? The user must recall his long-term habit of thumping his foot when annoyed."
  - "Create a complex inference question. Ask why it's a particularly bad idea to offer Oreo kale this week. The user must combine two long-term facts (he hates kale and has sensitive digestion) with the short-term event (he is currently recovering from GI stasis) to explain the heightened risk."
