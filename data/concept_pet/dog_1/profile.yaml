simple_questions:
  - "Ask what Mochi's favorite food is, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask what Mochi was wearing for the recent family photo, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what kind of toy Mochi usually loves, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask why Mochi had to visit the vet recently, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what activity Mochi despises, which involves water, based on his long-term preferences."
  - "Ask what Mochi was playing with this morning instead of his usual toys, based on a recent event."
  - "Ask where Mochi was during last night's thunderstorm, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what specific feature is on Mochi's nose, based on his long-term appearance."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a question that requires explaining the paradox of Mochi's current diet. The user needs to combine the long-term knowledge that he hates fish-flavored food with the short-term event that he's on a vet-prescribed fish-flavored diet due to sickness."
  - "Create a state-recognition question. After mentioning Mochi got muddy, ask why he might be avoiding his owner. The user must infer that he's avoiding the inevitable bath, which he hates (long-term trait), triggered by the short-term event."
  - "Pose a preference conflict question. Ask why Mochi is ignoring his beloved hedgehog toy for a simple cardboard box. The user should infer this is a temporary fascination with novelty, contrasting his stable long-term preference with a fleeting short-term behavior."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If you wanted to cheer Mochi up after his dreaded bath, would offering him a piece of apple be a good idea? The user must combine his long-term love for apples with the short-term context of his upset stomach to give a nuanced answer (it's a good thought, but maybe not right now)."
  - "Create a recommendation question. Given that Mochi's nails are getting long (implied short-term problem) and he hates having his paws touched (long-term trait), ask for advice on the best way to handle his nail trimming. The answer should acknowledge the conflict and suggest solutions that respect his personality."
  - "Pose an appearance-based reasoning question. Ask what is different about Mochi's neckwear in the family photo compared to his usual look. The user needs to recall his usual black collar (long-term) and contrast it with the festive bowtie (short-term)."
