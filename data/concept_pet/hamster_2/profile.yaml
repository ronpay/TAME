challenge_question:
- 'Pose a preference conflict question: Ask why Milo isn''t getting his favorite sunflower
  seeds right now. The user must combine the long-term knowledge that he loves them
  with the short-term event that the owner restricted them due to his weight.'
- 'Create a state-recognition question: Ask why Milo might seem less active or happy
  at night lately. The user must connect his long-term love for a silent wheel with
  the short-term event of it being replaced by a squeaky, temporary one.'
- 'Ask a ''what-if'' question: If the owner decides to deep-clean Milo''s cage at 1
  PM tomorrow, how would Milo likely react? The user must use long-term knowledge about
  his nocturnal nature and hatred for daytime cleaning to predict his stressed reaction.'
- 'Pose a question explaining a recent observation: The owner offered Milo a piece
  of fruit, but he refused to eat it. Why? The user needs to combine the specific
  short-term event (offered an orange) with the long-term knowledge that he dislikes
  citrus fruits.'
- 'Create a recommendation question: Milo seems bored and has destroyed his favorite
  toy. What would be a good, cheap, and safe replacement toy for him? The user must
  recall his long-term love for cardboard tubes to suggest a new one.'
- 'Pose a complex behavioral question: Why was it particularly stressful for Milo to
  have his cage cleaned recently? The user must combine the short-term event (it was
  an emergency clean) with the long-term knowledge (he hates daytime cleaning) to
  explain the heightened stress.'
