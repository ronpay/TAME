    fur right between his ears? It's his signature look.

    it.'

    ever recommend things like oranges or grapefruit for him.'

  user_input: A quick heads-up about Milo's behavior. He really hates having his cage
    cleaned, especially if I do it during the day when he's trying to sleep. It stresses
    him out.
  assistant_response: 'Okay, I''ve logged a key behavioral note: Milo dislikes having
    his cage cleaned, particularly during the daytime. I''ll remember that.'

  user_input: Milo is also a bit skittish. Loud noises really startle him, so I try to
    keep things quiet around his cage.
  assistant_response: Got it. Milo is skittish and is scared by loud noises. I've added
    this to his personality profile.

  assistant_response: How cute! I've noted that Milo's favorite toy is a simple cardboard
    tube.
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo, the Syrian hamster, peeking out from one end of a
    standard brown cardboard toilet paper tube. He is inside his cage, which has deep

  user_input: One last thing for now, Milo gets pretty anxious if I hold him for too
    long. A few minutes is okay, but he doesn't like long cuddle sessions.
  assistant_response: Okay, I understand. Milo does not like to be held for extended
    periods. I've made a note of it.

  user_input: So, about those sunflower seeds... I think he ate a few too many recently.
    He's looking a bit chubby. [IMAGE] I'm cutting them out of his diet for a little
    while.
  assistant_response: 'I see. I''ve noted a temporary change: no more sunflower seeds
    for now because he''s gained a little weight. I hope he slims down soon!'
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo, the Syrian hamster, looking noticeably rounder and
    chubbier than in previous photos. He is sitting in the corner of his cage, grooming
    himself.

  user_input: Ugh, disaster struck. His big silent wheel broke last night. I had to
    put in this smaller, old one I had, and it's a bit squeaky. [IMAGE] He doesn't
    seem to like it as much.
  assistant_response: 'Oh no! I''ve recorded the event: his favorite silent wheel
    is broken and has been temporarily replaced with a smaller, squeaky one. I hope
    you can get a new one soon.'
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo's cage showing a smaller, brightly colored plastic
    hamster wheel that looks less premium than the one in the previous photo. Milo
    is sniffing it cautiously, not running on it.

    logged this as a new, positive experience for him.

  user_input: I had to do an emergency cage cleaning today, right in the middle of
    the afternoon. His water bottle leaked and soaked all his bedding. [IMAGE] He
    was not happy about being woken up.
  assistant_response: 'Oh, that sounds stressful for both of you. I''ve noted the
    reason for the emergency daytime cage cleaning: a leaked water bottle. I''ve also
    noted that it was a stressful event for him.'
  image_prompt: A photo of the inside of a hamster cage with dark, wet patches all
    over the bedding. A water bottle is dripping onto the floor. Milo is huddled in

  user_input: I just tried giving him a tiny piece of orange to see if he'd like it.
    As you can see, he just sniffed it and walked away. [IMAGE] Total rejection.
  assistant_response: I've recorded that. You recently offered Milo a piece of orange,
    and he completely ignored it, which confirms his dislike for citrus.
  image_prompt: A close-up shot of a small slice of orange on the bedding of a hamster
    cage. Milo, the hamster, is seen in the frame but is turned away from the orange,
    heading in the opposite direction.

    this event. Time for a new toy!
