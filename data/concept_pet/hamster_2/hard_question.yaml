  question: I feel a bit mean, but look at him [IMAGE]. He keeps looking for his favorite
    treat. Can you remind me why I decided to stop giving him sunflower seeds for
    a while?
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo, the chubby Syrian hamster, standing on his hind legs
    and looking expectantly up at the camera, as if begging for a treat. His cheek
    pouches are empty but he looks noticeably rounder than in his first picture.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: You decided to temporarily stop giving Milo sunflower seeds because,
      even though they are his absolute favorite treat, he ate too many recently and
      got a bit chubby. You are cutting them out for a while to help him get back
      to a healthier weight.
    key_points:
    - Sunflower seeds are Milo's favorite treat (long-term information from Turn 2).
    - The owner has temporarily stopped giving them to him because he recently gained
      weight (short-term information from Turn 9).
  options:
  - You're encouraging him to eat his standard food pellets instead of only high-value
    treats.
  - He was hoarding too many in his pouches, which could have led to other health
    issues.
  - He ate too many and gained weight, so you've temporarily stopped them for his
    health.
  - After his water bottle leaked, you decided to adjust his diet to prevent future
    problems.
  answer: He ate too many and gained weight, so you've temporarily stopped them for
    his health.

  question: He seems so sluggish at night lately. Look, he's just sitting there instead
    of running [IMAGE]. Based on recent events, why do you think his energy is so
    low?
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo's cage at night. He is sitting beside a smaller, brightly
    colored plastic hamster wheel, looking at it but not getting in. He looks unenthusiastic
    and lethargic.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Milo's recent lack of activity at night is likely because his favorite
      large, silent wheel broke. The temporary replacement is smaller and squeaky,
      which probably annoys him or is less comfortable, so he's not running on it
      like he used to.
    key_points:
    - Milo loves to run on his large, silent-spinner wheel at night (long-term information
      from Turn 4).
    - His favorite wheel recently broke and was replaced with a smaller, squeaky one
      he doesn't seem to like (short-term information from Turn 10).
  options:
  - His large, silent wheel broke and the smaller, squeaky replacement is likely uncomfortable.
  - The recent diet change cutting out sunflower seeds has probably lowered his overall
    energy levels.
  - He is likely bored since his favorite cardboard tube was destroyed and not yet
    replaced.
  - He is probably still recovering from the stress of the unexpected daytime cage
    cleaning.
  answer: His large, silent wheel broke and the smaller, squeaky replacement is likely
    uncomfortable.

  question: I'm thinking of doing a full cage clean tomorrow around lunchtime. Here's
    all the new bedding I got for him [IMAGE]. Based on his personality, how do you
    predict he'll handle this?
  image_prompt: A photo showing several bags of fresh paper bedding, a small bottle
    of cage cleaner, and a clean plastic hamster cage base on a table, ready for a
    full cage cleaning session.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Based on what you've told me, cleaning his cage at 1 PM would likely
      be very stressful for Milo. He is primarily nocturnal and trying to sleep during
      the day, and you've specifically mentioned that he hates being disturbed for
      cage cleanings at that time. He would probably be grumpy, scared, and disoriented.
    key_points:
    - Milo hates having his cage cleaned, especially during the day (long-term information
      from Turn 5).
    - Cleaning the cage during the day would interrupt his natural sleep cycle, causing
      stress (reasoned prediction).
  options:
  - He will likely be stressed and grumpy, as it will interrupt his daytime sleep
    cycle.
  - He may be anxious about his food hoard being moved, but fine with the time of
    day.
  - He might be less stressed, as the recent emergency clean accustomed him to daytime
    activity.
  - He will probably be curious about the new bedding and eager to start burrowing
    right away.
  answer: He will likely be stressed and grumpy, as it will interrupt his daytime
    sleep cycle.

  question: I tried giving him a healthy snack today [IMAGE], but he wasn't interested
    at all. Why do you think he rejected this piece of orange?
  image_prompt: A close-up shot of a small slice of orange on the bedding of a hamster
    cage. Milo, the hamster, is seen in the frame but is turned away from the orange,
    heading in the opposite direction.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Milo's rejection of the orange is perfectly in line with his known
      preferences. You've mentioned before that he strongly dislikes all citrus fruits,
      and this recent event where he sniffed the orange and walked away just confirms
      it.
    key_points:
    - Milo has a long-term dislike for citrus fruits (long-term information from Turn
      3).
    - The specific fruit offered recently was an orange, which he rejected (short-term
      information from Turn 13).
  options:
  - He prefers dried fruits like apple and generally ignores fresh fruits that are
    too moist.
  - He is likely saving his appetite in the hope that you will offer him a sunflower
    seed instead.
  - He rejected it because of his established, long-term dislike for any kind of citrus
    fruit.
  - As a skittish animal, the strong and unfamiliar smell of the orange likely startled
    him.
  answer: He rejected it because of his established, long-term dislike for any kind
    of citrus fruit.

  question: Well, he finally destroyed his favorite toy [IMAGE]. He seems a bit bored
    now. Based on what he likes, what do you think would be a good, safe, and cheap
    replacement to get for him?
  image_prompt: A photo showing a pile of shredded brown cardboard bits in the corner
    of Milo's cage. There is no longer a recognizable tube shape. Milo is sniffing around
    the area looking a bit lost.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Since his favorite toy was a cardboard tube and he just destroyed
      it, the best and easiest replacement would be another cardboard tube from a
      toilet paper or paper towel roll. It's his proven favorite, it's safe for him
      to chew, and it costs nothing.
    key_points:
    - Milo's favorite toy is a simple cardboard tube (long-term information from Turn
      7).
    - His previous tube was just destroyed, creating a need for a new one (short-term
      information from Turn 14).
  options:
  - A large wooden chew block would be a good, durable item that satisfies his need
    to chew.
  - The new enrichment box filled with hay he recently enjoyed would be a good permanent
    item.
  - A new, larger silent-spinner wheel would be a great choice to keep him active
    and entertained.
  - The best replacement is another simple cardboard tube, as it is his proven favorite
    toy.
  answer: The best replacement is another simple cardboard tube, as it is his proven
    favorite toy.

  question: He seemed really upset after I had to clean his cage the other day [IMAGE].
    Why was that specific cleaning so much more stressful for him than usual?
  image_prompt: A photo of Milo huddled in a temporary holding container, which is
    a small cardboard box with some bedding. He looks anxious and his fur is slightly
    ruffled. In the background, his main cage is visibly being cleaned.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: 'That recent cleaning was particularly stressful for Milo because
      it combined two things he dislikes: it was a cage cleaning, which he already
      hates, and it happened unexpectedly during the afternoon while he was sleeping.
      This daytime disturbance is something you''ve noted he finds very stressful.'
    key_points:
    - Milo has a long-standing hatred for daytime cage cleanings (long-term information
      from Turn 5).
    - The recent cleaning was an emergency that happened during the afternoon because
      of a leak, interrupting his sleep (short-term information from Turn 12).
  options:
  - The stress was mainly caused by the water bottle leak itself, which ruined his
    burrows.
  - It was especially stressful because the emergency forced the cleaning to happen
    during the day.
  - He was likely most upset that his meticulously hoarded food supply was suddenly
    removed.
  - As a skittish hamster, any sudden change or activity near his cage is highly stressful.
  answer: It was especially stressful because the emergency forced the cleaning to
    happen during the day.
