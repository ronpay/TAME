simple_questions:
- Ask what Pip's favorite food is, based on his long-term knowledge.
- Ask why Pip was so restless a couple of nights ago, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what kind of house Pip normally has in his cage, based on long-term knowledge.
- Ask what treat Pip recently refused to eat, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what specific noise Pip hates, based on his long-term preferences.
- Ask why Pip was re-hoarding his food all night recently, based on a short-term event.
- Ask who was holding Pip in the recent stressful photo, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what kind of toys Pip prefers, based on his long-term knowledge.
challenge_question:
- Pose a question that requires explaining Pip's recent agitated behavior. The user
  must connect his long-term love for running on his wheel with the short-term event
  that the wheel broke.
- Create a state-recognition question. The owner mentions Pip is hiding and won't
  even come out for an apple slice. Ask for the most likely reason. The user must
  combine the long-term knowledge of his hatred for loud noises (vacuum) with the
  short-term event where he refused a treat he normally likes.
- Pose a preference conflict question. Ask why Pip is ignoring the new plastic igloo
  in his cage. The user must synthesize his long-term attachment to the ceramic house
  with the short-term event of it being temporarily replaced due to a crack.
- 'Ask for advice: The owner''s cousin wants to buy Pip a gift and suggests a fun-looking
  plastic ball with a bell inside. Is this a good gift for Pip? The user must use
  long-term knowledge (hates loud plastic toys) to explain why it''s a bad idea.'
- 'Create a ''what-if'' question: If the owner had cleaned the cage but left Pip''s
  main food hoard untouched, how would his behavior have been different that night?
  The user must infer that he would have been calm, contrasting the short-term frantic
  re-hoarding event with his normal behavior based on his long-term preferences.'
- Pose a question that requires explaining a contradiction. Why did Pip, who loves
  food, refuse the yogurt drops? The user must combine the general knowledge that
  hamsters love to eat with the specific long-term preference that he hates sugary
  yogurt drops, confirmed by the short-term event.
