  question: He's been so restless and agitated for the last couple of nights, just
    pacing around. Look at this picture from yesterday [IMAGE]. Any idea what's causing
    this sudden change in his behavior?
  image_prompt: A photo of Pip, the golden-brown hamster, pacing restlessly back and
    forth inside his cage. In the background, his silent-spin running wheel is clearly
    visible, but it's tilted at an unnatural angle, obviously broken and unusable.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Pip is likely so agitated because his silent wheel is broken. You've
      mentioned that running on his wheel for a long time is a major part of his nightly
      routine, so being unable to do that for the past two nights has made him very
      restless.
    key_points:
    - Running on his wheel is Pip's essential nightly routine (long-term information).
    - His wheel recently broke, preventing this activity and causing his current agitation
      (short-term information).
  options:
  - He's likely still stressed from the recent cage cleaning where you moved his main
    food hoard, making him feel insecure in his territory.
  - His agitation is likely due to his broken silent wheel, as running on it is his
    primary nightly activity and he's been unable to do so.
  - This behavior probably stems from the stress of being held for too long by your
    cousin, which made him feel unsafe in his cage.
  - His restlessness is probably because his ceramic house was replaced with a plastic
    one, disrupting his sense of security and routine.
  answer: His agitation is likely due to his broken silent wheel, as running on it
    is his primary nightly activity and he's been unable to do so.

  question: Poor Pip is hiding and won't come out, even for this apple slice which
    he usually loves. Here's a picture [IMAGE]. What could be so scary that he's refusing
    a treat?
  image_prompt: A photo looking down into a hamster cage with clean bedding. A small,
    fresh slice of apple sits untouched near the entrance to a burrow. Only Pip's
    nose and a bit of his golden-brown fur are visible as he peeks out from deep within
    the bedding pile, looking scared.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Given that Pip is hiding and refusing a treat, it's almost certainly
      because you were just using the vacuum cleaner. You've established that the
      vacuum is his 'arch-nemesis' and he hates loud noises, so this extreme fear
      is consistent with his known personality.
    key_points:
    - Pip has a long-standing, intense hatred for the sound of the vacuum cleaner
      (long-term information).
    - The vacuum was just used, and his current extreme fear (hiding, refusing a treat)
      is a direct result of that event (short-term information).
  options:
  - He's likely terrified of the vacuum cleaner's noise, a fear so strong it overrides
    his love for treats like apples.
  - He's feeling unwell and has lost his appetite due to the general stress from his
    silent wheel being broken for two nights.
  - He's still upset about his food hoard being moved during the cleaning, so he's
    hiding to protect his new stash from being taken.
  - The stress from being held by your cousin may have made him generally fearful
    of anyone approaching the cage, even with a treat.
  answer: He's likely terrified of the vacuum cleaner's noise, a fear so strong it
    overrides his love for treats like apples.

  question: I had to swap out his cracked ceramic house for this plastic igloo for
    now [IMAGE], but he's completely ignoring it and sleeping in a corner instead.
    Why won't he use it?
  image_prompt: A photo of a hamster cage setup. A new, brightly colored plastic igloo-style
    hideout is prominently featured. Pip the hamster is seen sleeping in a corner
    of the cage, burrowed into the bedding, clearly ignoring the new house.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Pip is ignoring the new plastic igloo because it's not his beloved
      purple-roofed ceramic house. You've established that the ceramic house is his
      most prized possession, so this sudden replacement, even if temporary, is unwelcome
      to him.
    key_points:
    - Pip has a strong long-term attachment to his specific purple-roofed ceramic
      house (long-term information).
    - The house was recently replaced by a plastic igloo, which he is now ignoring
      (short-term information).
  options:
  - He prefers to sleep in deep burrows he creates himself rather than in any kind
    of pre-made structure, plastic or ceramic.
  - He is likely ignoring the igloo because he has a strong attachment to his specific
    purple-roofed ceramic house, and this is an unwelcome replacement.
  - He is likely feeling too agitated from his broken wheel to investigate new items,
    preferring the familiarity of a simple burrow.
  - He probably dislikes the smell of the plastic and finds the material too cold
    compared to the ceramic house he was used to.
  answer: He is likely ignoring the igloo because he has a strong attachment to his
    specific purple-roofed ceramic house, and this is an unwelcome replacement.

  question: Last night I moved his food stash while cleaning, and he was a frantic
    mess all night re-hoarding, like in this picture [IMAGE]. What do you think would
    have happened if I'd cleaned the cage but managed to leave his main food hoard
    exactly where it was?
  image_prompt: A photo of Pip the hamster in a freshly cleaned cage. His cheek pouches
    are stuffed full of food. He is captured mid-action, frantically moving pieces
    of food mix into a new corner, creating a large pile. He looks stressed and single-minded.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Based on his known personality, if you had cleaned the cage but
      left his main food hoard undisturbed, he likely would have been much calmer.
      The frantic, all-night re-hoarding you saw was a direct reaction to his stash
      being moved, which you've noted makes him very grumpy. Without that trigger,
      he probably would have just gone about his normal nightly routine.
    key_points:
    - Pip gets very grumpy and compulsively re-hoards when his main food stash is
      moved (long-term information).
    - Last night's frantic behavior was caused by his hoard being moved, so removing
      that cause would have resulted in normal, calm behavior (short-term information
      contrasted with a counterfactual).
  options:
  - He would have been much calmer and likely gone about his normal routine, as his
    frantic behavior was a direct result of his main food hoard being moved.
  - He would still have been somewhat agitated, as any change to his cage environment,
    even just replacing the bedding, can be stressful for him.
  - He would have spent the night re-scenting the entire cage to mark his new territory,
    but without the frantic hoarding behavior.
  - His behavior wouldn't have changed, as the stress was likely caused by the lingering
    smell of cleaning products, not the location of his food.
  answer: He would have been much calmer and likely gone about his normal routine,
    as his frantic behavior was a direct result of his main food hoard being moved.

  question: I know hamsters are supposed to love treats, but I bought him these yogurt
    drops [IMAGE] and he completely snubbed them. Why would he refuse a treat?
  image_prompt: A photo taken inside a hamster cage. On the clean bedding, there is
    a small pile of colorful (pink, yellow, green) yogurt drops. Pip, the hamster,
    is shown in the frame turning his back on the treats and walking away, looking
    completely uninterested.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: While hamsters are known for hoarding food, you've specifically
      mentioned in the past that Pip has an intense dislike for sugary yogurt drops.
      His recent refusal to eat the ones you offered is perfectly in line with this
      very specific preference.
    key_points:
    - Pip has a specific, long-standing hatred for sugary yogurt drops (long-term
      information).
    - He recently refused these exact treats, which confirms his known preference
      rather than being a contradiction (short-term information).
  options:
  - He didn't eat them because his cheek pouches were already full, and he prioritizes
    hoarding his main food mix over eating new treats on the spot.
  - He prefers natural treats like seeds and apple, and likely found the artificial
    smell of the colorful yogurt drops unappealing.
  - His refusal is consistent with his known strong dislike for the sugary, brightly
    colored yogurt drops sold in pet stores.
  - He might be refusing all new foods right now due to the combined stress of his
    broken wheel and the recent cage cleaning.
  answer: His refusal is consistent with his known strong dislike for the sugary,
    brightly colored yogurt drops sold in pet stores.

  question: Since Pip's wheel is broken and he's so restless, I was thinking of getting
    him a new toy to keep him busy. A friend suggested this plastic ball with a bell
    inside [IMAGE]. Given his current agitated state, do you think this would be a
    good distraction for him?
  image_prompt: A person's hand holding a brightly colored, transparent plastic hamster
    ball. A small metal bell is clearly visible inside the ball.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: That's probably not the best choice for him, especially right now.
      You've mentioned before that Pip dislikes fancy, noisy plastic toys and prefers
      simple things like cardboard tubes. A loud bell would likely add more stress
      to his current agitated state rather than calming him down.
    key_points:
    - Pip has a long-term dislike for noisy plastic toys (long-term information).
    - He is currently agitated because his wheel is broken, so a stressful toy would
      be a bad choice for distraction (short-term information).
  options:
  - No, this is a poor choice because he is known to dislike loud, plastic toys, and
    the bell would likely increase his current stress.
  - Yes, the noise and movement could be a good mental distraction, helping him burn
    off the energy he can't use on his wheel.
  - It might work temporarily; while he dislikes noisy toys, his current restlessness
    might make him desperate enough for any new stimulation.
  - No, these balls can be unsafe as they don't allow for proper ventilation and prevent
    him from using his whiskers to navigate properly.
  answer: No, this is a poor choice because he is known to dislike loud, plastic toys,
    and the bell would likely increase his current stress.
