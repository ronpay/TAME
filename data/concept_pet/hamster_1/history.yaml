    his main food stash during a cage clean. He'll spend the rest of the night putting
    it all back.

  user_input: I did a deep clean on the cage last night, which meant I had to move
    his main food hoard. Just as I predicted, he spent the entire night frantically
    re-hoarding everything into a new corner. [IMAGE]

    Pip the hamster is captured in a flurry of activity, his cheek pouches visibly
    stuffed full. He is surrounded by a large pile of hamster food mix that he is

    He's not a fan. [IMAGE]

    used to be, there is now a brightly colored plastic igloo-style hideout. Pip the

  user_input: I was just vacuuming near his cage, and poor Pip totally freaked out.
    He's been hiding in his bedding for the last hour and won't even come out for
    a slice of apple. [IMAGE]

    the vacuum cleaner caused Pip to hide, and he is so scared that he even refused
    an apple slice, a food he normally likes.'
  image_prompt: A photo looking down into a hamster cage. The only visible part of
    Pip is his nose and a bit of his fur peeking out from deep under a large pile
    of paper bedding. A small, fresh slice of apple sits untouched near the entrance
    to his burrow.
