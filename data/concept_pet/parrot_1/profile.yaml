challenge_question:
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: Why is Mango ignoring the new, colorful toy his owner just gave him? The user must combine the long-term knowledge that he hates hard plastic with the short-term event that he received a plastic toy."
  - "Create a state-explanation question: Mango usually hates his pellets, but now he is eating them. Why the sudden change? The user needs to connect his long-term hatred of pellets with the short-term solution of mixing them with his favorite fruit, mango."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If the owner had bought Mango another soft wood toy with a bell instead of the plastic one, how would he likely be behaving now? The user must infer a positive reaction based on his long-term love for bell toys, contrasting it with his current indifference to the new toy."
  - "Pose a recommendation question: Mango isn't eating his healthy food. Based on what you know, what's a strategy that might work to get him to eat? The user should recall the recent successful event and suggest mixing the food with something he loves, like fruit puree."
  - "Create a behavioral analysis question: The owner gave Mango his new plastic toy right after the old bell toy broke. What might Mango be feeling about this replacement? The user should infer disappointment or frustration by contrasting the disliked new object with the beloved old one."
  - "Pose a complex 'why' question: Mango loves his owner's shoulder, but he just nipped them. Why would he do that? The user needs to connect his long-term love for being on the shoulder with his long-term hatred of having his tail touched, and the short-term event that triggered the nip."
