history:
  knowledge:
  - 'Introduce Captain Comet''s key features: his orange wen and white fins.'
  - Mention his favorite treat is bloodworms.
  - State clearly that he hates being fed peas.
  - 'Describe his favorite tank object: a large, smooth, mossy rock.'
  - Explain his hatred for the stress of water changes.
  - Point out the permanent 'No Fishing' sign in his tank.
  - Introduce his preference for high-quality gel food for daily meals.
  - Mention his dislike for sharp plastic decorations.
  event:
  - Introduce a recent event where Comet developed a mild swim bladder issue, making
    him float lopsided.
  - State that as a treatment, the owner has been feeding him only shelled peas for
    the past two days.
  - Describe a recent major water change where the owner rearranged the entire tank.
  - Mention that during the rearrangement, the owner replaced his beloved mossy rock.
  - State that the new replacement is a brightly colored plastic castle with some
    pointy towers.
  - Share a recent observation that Comet has been hiding behind the filter intake
    and has refused to eat the peas.
simple_questions:
- Ask what Captain Comet's favorite special food is, based on his long-term knowledge.
- Ask what new item was recently added to his tank, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what happened to Comet's mossy rock, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what kind of food Comet absolutely hates, based on his long-term preferences.
- Ask why Comet was floating strangely recently, based on a short-term event.
- Ask what food he is currently being fed, based on the recent vet advice.
- Ask what permanent decoration is always in Comet's tank, based on long-term knowledge.
- Ask what activity stresses Comet out the most, based on his long-term preferences.
challenge_question:
- 'Pose a preference conflict question: Why is Captain Comet refusing to eat? The
  user must connect his long-term hatred of peas with the short-term fact that peas
  are what he is being fed for his health.'
- Create a state-recognition question. Ask for an explanation of Comet's current hiding
  behavior. The user must synthesize his long-term hatred of water changes and sharp
  plastic with the short-term events of the recent tank cleaning and the addition
  of the new castle.
- 'Ask a ''what-if'' question: If the owner were to put his old mossy rock back in
  the tank right now, how might Comet''s behavior change? The user must infer that
  seeing a beloved object (long-term preference) might coax him out of hiding, despite
  his ongoing sickness (short-term state).'
- 'Pose a complex ''why'' question: Explain the irony of Comet''s current situation.
  The user needs to articulate that the actions taken to improve his health (feeding
  peas) and environment (cleaning the tank) are, from his perspective, negative experiences
  due to his long-term preferences.'
- 'Create a recommendation question: Given that Comet is sick but won''t eat the prescribed
  peas, what should the owner try next? The user must acknowledge the food preference
  conflict and suggest a solution that respects his long-term tastes, like trying
  to mash the peas with a tiny amount of his favorite gel food.'
- Pose a behavioral analysis question. Ask to evaluate if the new plastic castle was
  a good choice for Comet. The user must contrast the castle's features (sharp, plastic)
  with Comet's long-term preferences (hates sharp plastic, loves smooth rocks) to
  conclude it was a poor choice.
