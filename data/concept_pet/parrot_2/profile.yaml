  - "Ask what common household item Kiko is terrified of, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask what new toy the owner recently got to keep Kiko from getting bored, based on a short-term event."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: Why is Kiko so interested in the tennis ball, given that his favorite toys are wooden blocks? The user must infer that the novelty of the texture and shape is a temporary fascination, contrasting his long-term destructive play with this new, non-destructive curiosity."
  - "Create a recommendation question: Given that Kiko is plucking his feathers (short-term event) and the vet is pushing a pellet diet he hates (long-term preference vs. short-term advice), what's a good strategy for his owner? The user must synthesize these facts and his love for puzzles (long-term) to suggest using the new foraging toy to deliver the pellets, making the food a fun challenge."
  - "Pose a 'why' question about the owner's actions: Why did Kiko's owner try to hide pellets in a piece of apple? The user must combine the knowledge of Kiko's love for apples (long-term) with his hatred for pellets (long-term) and the vet's recent advice (short-term) to explain the owner's logic."
  - "Create a state-recognition question based on the image: The image shows Kiko with a tennis ball. Ask what this says about his current mood. The user should combine the visual evidence of him being engaged with a new object (short-term) with his known intelligence (long-term) to infer he is likely feeling curious and mentally stimulated, not bored."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If the owner scattered walnuts and pellets together in Kiko's bowl, what would Kiko likely do? The user must use his long-term preferences to predict he would meticulously pick out and eat the walnuts while throwing the pellets out of the cage."
  - "Create a behavioral analysis question: Why is Kiko's mimicry of the video call sound a bigger problem than him mimicking the microwave? The user should infer that while the microwave beep is a predictable request for food (long-term learned behavior), the new, random call notification (short-term event) is more disruptive to the owner's work-from-home life."
