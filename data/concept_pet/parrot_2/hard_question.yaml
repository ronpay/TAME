  question: Hey, look at him with this tennis ball [IMAGE]. Based on what you know,
    why is he so into it? I thought his favorite thing was destroying wooden toys,
    not just rolling a ball around.
  image_prompt: A wide shot of Kiko, the African Grey Parrot, standing on top of his
    large metal cage. He is using his black beak to gently nudge a bright yellow tennis
    ball. He appears curious and engaged with the new object.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: While Kiko's favorite activity is destroying wooden toys, his fascination
      with the new tennis ball likely stems from his high intelligence and curiosity.
      The new object offers a different kind of stimulation—a new texture and the
      physics of rolling—which is temporarily captivating for him, even if it's not
      his usual destructive fun.
    key_points:
    - Kiko's favorite toys are wooden ones he can destroy (long-term information).
    - He is currently fascinated by a new, non-destructible tennis ball, likely due
      to the novelty and mental stimulation it provides (short-term event contrasted
      with long-term preference).
  options:
  - He is likely testing the ball's durability, becoming frustrated that he cannot
    splinter it like his usual wooden blocks.
  - His preference has shifted; the ball's rolling motion is now more mentally engaging
    than his static wooden toys.
  - This is a temporary fascination driven by his intelligence; the new texture and
    physics offer a novel form of stimulation.
  - He is trying to get your attention, as the ball's bright yellow color is more
    visually striking than his other toys.
  answer: This is a temporary fascination driven by his intelligence; the new texture
    and physics offer a novel form of stimulation.

  question: With Kiko plucking his feathers from boredom and the vet insisting on
    this pellet diet he hates, I'm stuck. I just got him this new puzzle toy [IMAGE].
    Do you think I could use it to solve both problems at once? How would that work?
  image_prompt: A photo of Kiko, the African Grey Parrot, actively interacting with
    a new, complex-looking foraging puzzle toy made of colorful acrylic. The toy has
    multiple small drawers and levers. Kiko is using his beak to try and open a compartment.
    He looks very focused and stimulated.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: That's an excellent strategy. Since Kiko is bored and loves the
      challenge of foraging puzzles, you could put the vet-recommended pellets inside
      his new toy. This would turn eating the hated food into a rewarding mental challenge,
      which could alleviate his boredom and might make him more willing to eat the
      pellets.
    key_points:
    - Kiko is bored (feather plucking), hates pellets, but loves solving foraging
      puzzles (long-term and short-term information).
    - Using the new foraging toy to serve the pellets could make eating them a mentally
      stimulating activity, addressing both boredom and the diet change (reasoned
      suggestion).
  options:
  - Yes, this strategy addresses both issues by turning the hated pellets into a rewarding
    puzzle, alleviating his boredom.
  - This is risky; he is smart enough to associate the puzzle with the pellets he
    hates, causing him to reject the new toy.
  - The puzzle will solve his boredom, but you should mix pellets with walnuts in
    his main bowl to get him to eat them.
  - No, a toy should not be used for food. This will confuse him and won't stop the
    feather plucking, which is a separate issue.
  answer: Yes, this strategy addresses both issues by turning the hated pellets into
    a rewarding puzzle, alleviating his boredom.

  question: Here's the aftermath of my failed experiment [IMAGE]. Thinking back, why
    did I even think hiding pellets in an apple would work? Can you remind me of the
    logic I was following?
  image_prompt: A shot of a bird food bowl containing a piece of crisp apple that
    has been clearly eaten around. Several small, cylindrical bird food pellets are
    left untouched, either still embedded in the remaining apple or scattered beside
    it.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Your logic was to use a food he likes to introduce a food he hates.
      You knew he would eat the apple, and since the vet recently recommended switching
      him to pellets, you were hoping he might ingest some of the pellets along with
      the apple he was eating.
    key_points:
    - Kiko dislikes pellets but will eat apple (long-term preference inferred from
      history).
    - The vet recently recommended pellets, so you tried to use a liked food to introduce
      a disliked but necessary one (short-term goal driving the action).
  options:
  - Your logic was to use his love for apples to introduce the vet-recommended pellets
    he hates, hoping he'd eat them together.
  - You likely recalled the vet suggesting that new foods should be introduced alongside
    familiar items like his favorite apple.
  - You probably assumed his strong preference for apples would be enough to mask
    the unpleasant texture of the pellets.
  - You were likely trying to add nutritional variety by combining a fruit he enjoys
    with the new pellet food in his bowl.
  answer: Your logic was to use his love for apples to introduce the vet-recommended
    pellets he hates, hoping he'd eat them together.

  question: Look at him with this tennis ball [IMAGE]. Given that he's an intelligent
    bird, what does this new fascination tell you about his current state of mind?
    Is he happy, just killing time, or something else?
  image_prompt: A wide shot of Kiko, the African Grey Parrot, standing on top of his
    large metal cage. He is using his black beak to gently nudge a bright yellow tennis
    ball. He appears curious and engaged with the new object.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Given Kiko's intelligence and love for puzzles, his focused interaction
      with the new tennis ball suggests he is mentally stimulated and curious. He's
      not just playing randomly; he's likely exploring the new object's properties,
      which is a positive sign of engagement and a good antidote to boredom.
    key_points:
    - Kiko is known to be an intelligent bird who enjoys puzzles (long-term information).
    - He is currently engaged with a new object (the tennis ball), so his mood is
      likely curious and mentally stimulated (short-term state interpreted via long-term
      trait).
  options:
  - His focused interaction suggests he is mentally stimulated and curious, using
    his intelligence to explore the new object.
  - This behavior likely indicates boredom; he has exhausted his usual toys and is
    engaging with a less-preferred object.
  - His cautiousness suggests he is wary and agitated by the unfamiliar object, consistent
    with his normal wariness.
  - He is likely displaying territorial behavior by trying to push the unfamiliar
    object away from his personal space.
  answer: His focused interaction suggests he is mentally stimulated and curious,
    using his intelligence to explore the new object.

  question: I'm thinking of a new strategy for the pellet problem. What if I just
    mixed the pellets in with his absolute favorite food, walnuts, and put them in
    his bowl like this [IMAGE]? Predict what he would do.
  image_prompt: A photo of a bird food bowl filled with a mix of whole walnuts in
    their shells and small, cylindrical commercial bird food pellets. The two food
    types are mixed together.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: Based on his very strong and distinct preferences, Kiko would almost
      certainly use his beak to meticulously pick out all the walnuts to crack and
      eat them. Then, he would likely proceed to methodically throw every single pellet
      out of the bowl, as he is known to despise them.
    key_points:
    - Kiko loves walnuts above all else (long-term information).
    - Kiko actively hates and removes pellets from his bowl (long-term information).
  options:
  - He would become frustrated by the mix and refuse to eat anything, associating
    his favorite food with the pellets he hates.
  - He would likely eat the walnuts and simply leave the pellets, but not bother to
    actively throw the pellets out of the bowl.
  - He would meticulously eat all the walnuts and then proceed to methodically throw
    every single hated pellet out of the bowl.
  - He would eat some pellets by accident while trying to get to the walnuts, which
    might help him get used to their taste.
  answer: He would meticulously eat all the walnuts and then proceed to methodically
    throw every single hated pellet out of the bowl.

  question: Kiko has been mimicking sounds for a while, like the microwave. But this
    new video call sound he's making [IMAGE] is so much more disruptive. Why do you
    think this new mimicry is a bigger problem for me than the old one?
  image_prompt: A stylized image showing a sound wave icon next to a computer screen
    that displays a generic video call interface. In the corner, Kiko the parrot is
    shown with his beak open as if making a sound. The overall mood is one of slight
    annoyance or disruption.
  evaluation_criteria:
    ideal_answer: 'The microwave beep is a predictable sound with a clear context:
      he does it when he''s hungry. The new video call notification, however, is a
      random mimicry that directly interferes with your work, causing you to constantly
      check your computer for no reason. Its unpredictable and contextually confusing
      nature makes it much more disruptive.'
    key_points:
    - The microwave beep is a long-standing, predictable behavior tied to hunger (long-term
      information).
    - The new video call sound is random and directly disrupts the owner's work, making
      it more problematic than the predictable food request (analysis of short-term
      event's impact).
  options:
  - The microwave beep is a predictable request for food, while the video call sound's
    randomness directly disrupts your work.
  - The video call's frequency is likely closer to a natural alarm call for parrots,
    causing a more urgent response in you.
  - He has learned the video call sound gets a more immediate reaction, so he is using
    it more often to demand attention.
  - Mimicking a complex call sound shows higher intelligence and may signal that he
    has new, unmet needs or is bored.
  answer: The microwave beep is a predictable request for food, while the video call
    sound's randomness directly disrupts your work.
