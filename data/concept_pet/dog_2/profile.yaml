simple_questions:

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: A relative just gave Ghost a new plush duck toy. Why hasn't he played with it? The user must combine the short-term event (getting the toy) with his long-term hatred for plush toys."
  - "Create a state-recognition question. Show the photo of Ghost covered in mud and ask if he's likely happy or sad. The user must infer his happiness from his long-term love of playing in the park, overriding his currently messy state."
  - "Pose a 'what-if' question: If the owner offers Ghost one of the new hard biscuits they just bought, is he likely to eat it? The user must recall his long-term dislike for hard biscuits to predict his reaction to this new short-term item."
  - "Create a recommendation question. Given that Ghost is terrified of nail clipping (long-term) and the owner is trying a new grinder (short-term), ask for advice on what to do next to make the experience positive. The answer should acknowledge the conflict and suggest patient, positive reinforcement."
  - "Pose an explanation question. Ask the user to explain why Ghost is sniffing the fallen orange slice so cautiously. The user needs to connect his long-term hatred of citrus smells with the immediate situation."
  - "Create a complex inference question. Ask why the owner might be trying a new grooming tool like a nail grinder instead of the usual clippers. The user must infer the owner is looking for a solution to Ghost's long-standing, intense fear of nail clipping."
