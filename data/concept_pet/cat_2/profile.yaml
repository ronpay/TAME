simple_questions:
  - "Ask what Cheeto's favorite food is, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask why Cheeto was at the vet recently, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what Cheeto's favorite napping spot is, based on his long-term preferences."
  - "Ask what kind of toy Cheeto ignored this morning, based on a recent event."
  - "Ask if Cheeto enjoys being picked up, based on his long-term knowledge."
  - "Ask what forbidden snack Cheeto managed to get last night, based on a short-term event."
  - "Ask what happened when the owner tried to put a collar on Cheeto, based on a recent event."
  - "Ask about the one activity that can get the usually lazy Cheeto to exercise."

challenge_question:
  - "Pose a preference conflict question: Why is Cheeto currently so unhappy at mealtime? The user must combine the long-term knowledge that he hates dry kibble with the short-term event that he's on a vet-prescribed diet of it."
  - "Create a state-recognition question. Show the main image of Cheeto on the keyboard and ask to explain the situation fully. The user must identify Cheeto and explain that he is engaging in his favorite activity (sleeping on warm keyboards), not just randomly napping."
  - "Ask a 'what-if' question: If you wanted to get Cheeto a new toy for his birthday, would a fancy, multi-feature toy with a bell be a good gift? The user must use long-term knowledge (hates bells/fancy toys) and the recent event (ignored a new toy mouse) to answer no."
  - "Pose a behavioral prediction question: Your owner needs to send an urgent email, but you (as Cheeto) are asleep on the keyboard. What is likely to happen if they try to pick you up? The user must synthesize Cheeto's hatred of being moved with his love for that specific spot to predict a grumpy reaction."
  - "Create a recommendation question: Given that Cheeto is now on a diet (short-term) and is trying to steal other food like milk (recent event), what should his owner do? The answer requires connecting the diet, his long-term preferences, and his recent sneaky behavior."
  - "Pose a question about Cheeto's conflicting behavior: Cheeto is known to be extremely lazy, so why was he seen frantically running around the room recently? The user has to connect his general lazy trait with his specific long-term love for the laser pointer, which was highlighted in a recent event."
