challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Pose a question explaining why Chloe, a vibrant and creative designer, was recently seen working on a very boring, minimalist logo. The user must combine her long-term hatred of minimalism with the short-term event of the client rejection."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] Ask a 'what-if' question: If Marcus wanted to reward Chloe for her hard work on the frustrating project, would giving her a bonus to take a silent meditation retreat be a good gift? The user must infer 'no' by combining her long-term extroversion and hatred of silence with the context of her personality."
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] Describe a scene where Chloe is at her desk, quietly sharing donuts with the team but not making any of her usual puns. Ask what might have happened to make her act this way. The user must connect her coping mechanism (donuts) with her subdued mood to infer it's a result of the recent project's creative defeat."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Pose a question about Chloe and Leo: Chloe just lost a project pitch to Leo. Is their friendship in trouble? The user needs to understand their 'friendly but fierce rivalry' from the long-term profile is the norm, not a sign of a friendship ending."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Ask for a recommendation: Chloe's team has just finished a stressful quarter. Suggest a good team outing for them. The answer should reject corporate exercises and suggest something aligned with Chloe's loves, like a trip to an art museum, a flea market, or a co-op gaming cafe."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Pose a question about how Chloe should approach Marcus about her next project: She wants to ensure she gets more creative freedom. How should she argue her case? The user must acknowledge her stubbornness and bluntness but suggest a strategy that also respects Marcus's role of managing client expectations."
