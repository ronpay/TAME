challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Pose a question explaining the paradox: Why would a meticulous, logical software architect who hates chaos find so much joy in a messy, simple hot dog? The user must connect his high-stress job (recent bug event) with his need for simple, non-intellectual pleasures as an escape."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] Ask a 'what-if' question: If Maria wanted to apologize to Kenji for a tense week by taking him out, would a loud, popular sports bar be a good idea? The user must infer 'no' by combining his long-term hatred of loud places with his current work stress."
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] Describe a scene of Kenji at his desk late at night, surrounded by schematics, but he's carefully gluing a tiny piece onto a model ship. Ask what this tells you about his current state. The user must connect his coping mechanism (model kits) with the recent project crisis to deduce he is under extreme stress."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Pose a question about Kenji's daughter: Given their recent awkward phone call, what kind of activity could Kenji suggest that might actually help them connect? The user should avoid his interests (samurai films) and her interests (TikTok) and suggest a neutral, simple activity like going for a walk or, ironically, getting hot dogs at the park."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Ask for a recommendation: The high-stress project is finally over. What would be the perfect 'Kenji-style' weekend to recover? The answer should reject typical choices (party, fancy dinner) and suggest something like a quiet day for photography, a trip to his favorite diner, and uninterrupted time to work on his models."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Pose a question on communication: Kenji needs to explain the complex bug to a non-technical executive. How should he approach this, given his default blunt style? The user must recall his skill with analogies and suggest he use a simple architectural or engineering metaphor instead of technical jargon."
