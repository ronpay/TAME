challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Pose a question explaining why Ravi might have had mixed feelings about his anniversary dinner with Priya, even though it was a thoughtful gift. The user must combine his long-term hatred of deconstructed food with the short-term event of the surprise booking."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] Ask a 'what-if' question: If Ravi's daughter Maya suggested they spend an afternoon 'just messing around with paint with no plan,' how would Ravi likely react? The user must infer he would struggle, combining his love for Maya with his long-term dislike for unstructured activities."
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] Describe a scene where Ravi is staring angrily at his new oven and the kitchen smells burnt. Ask what is probably upsetting him so much. The user must connect the recent event (oven malfunction) with his long-term pride in his 'perfect' biryani to understand his deep frustration."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Ask for a gift recommendation for Ravi: His birthday is coming up. Would a gift certificate to a cutting-edge modern art gallery or a high-quality, classic leather-bound notebook be a better choice? The user must use his long-term preferences (hates formless art, is a meticulous architect) to make the right choice."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Pose a question on how Ravi could effectively mentor Tom without just getting frustrated. The user must acknowledge Ravi's meticulous nature and Tom's disorganization and suggest a structured solution, like creating shared checklists or project templates."
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Explain the irony of Ravi, an architect who embraces new technology in his work, getting so upset with his new high-tech oven. The user must combine the recent event (burnt biryani) with his long-term value for tradition (in cooking) to explain the apparent contradiction."
