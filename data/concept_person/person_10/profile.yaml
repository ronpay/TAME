challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Pose a question explaining why Maya looked so unhappy at the classical music concert, even though she went with her best friend. The user must combine her long-term hatred of sedentary activities with the specific short-term event."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] Ask a 'what-if' question: If Carlos wanted to plan a surprise birthday party for Maya, would a fancy, sit-down dinner at a Michelin-star restaurant be a good idea? The user must infer 'no' from her long-term dislike of formal dinners and passive events."
  - "Draft: [Career Path Origin] Ask how the old photo Maya found of herself playing a video game as a kid might connect to her career choice and her recent success with her patient, Leo. The user must link the childhood activity (gaming) to her adult profession (physical therapy) and her methods (gamification)."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Pose a question about Maya and Jenna's friendship: Are they a good match as friends, given their different ideas of fun? The user needs to understand from the 'workout buddy' dynamic and the concert event that their friendship works despite, or because of, these differences."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Ask for a recommendation: Maya has a free weekend. Based on everything you know, what would be the perfect 'Maya-style' plan? The answer should reject quiet options and suggest something like a trip to a new hiking trail, finding a beach volleyball game, or visiting a VR arcade with Carlos."
  - "Draft: [Problem Solving] Pose a question about Maya's work: Her patient Leo is getting bored of the 'game' she created. How should she approach their next session? The user must use her core traits (empathy, competitiveness, love of games) to suggest she would invent a 'sequel' or a 'new level' to keep him engaged."
