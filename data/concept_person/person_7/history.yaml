    Planner, and my specialty is historical preservation. This is a headshot from
    my company's site. [IMAGE] Also, you should know about Marcus Thorne. He's my
    main work rival—we're always bidding for the same projects. It's competitive,
    but it keeps me sharp.
  assistant_response: Got it, Elena. I've noted your occupation as an Urban Planner
    specializing in historical preservation and your professional rivalry with Marcus
    Thorne. Thanks for the photo.

    She has dark brown hair pulled back neatly, a direct gaze, and a confident but

  user_input: Just so you know my preferences, I absolutely can't stand being inactive.
    The idea of sitting through a long opera or one of those elaborate, multi-course
    fancy dinners just makes me restless. It's my personal version of torture.
  assistant_response: Understood. I've made a note of your strong dislike for long,
    slow, and inactive events like fancy dinners and operas. I'll keep that in mind.

    your father, David, and that he's a retired architect who influenced your career.
    Thanks for sharing.

  user_input: I'm all about things that are functional and simple. I don't do fussy.
    For example, I wear this classic silver watch with a metal band every single day.
    [IMAGE] Same goes for drinks—my go-to is just strong black tea.
  assistant_response: I see. Functional and simple. I've noted your preference for
    your classic silver watch and strong black tea. Thanks for the details.
  image_prompt: A close-up, detailed photo of Elena Vance's wrist. She is wearing

  user_input: Here's how I start most of my days. An early morning run through the

    morning runs through the city to clear your head. Thanks for the view!

    about that difficult climb Izzy and I did last week. He immediately started worrying
    about my 'reckless' hobbies. I know he means well, but it's a bit much sometimes.
  assistant_response: I understand. It can be tricky when family worries. I've noted
    the recent call with your father, David, where he expressed concern about your
    climbing.

    for most of the night. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: That does look tedious. I've noted that you recently had to
    attend a long, boring work awards dinner which you found excruciating. I hope
    the rest of your evening is more enjoyable.
  image_prompt: A photo taken from Elena's point of view, sitting at a round table
    in a dimly lit, formal banquet hall. The table is set with fancy china and half-empty
    wine glasses. In the distance, a person is speaking at a podium, but the focus
    is on the general atmosphere of stuffy formality.
