    majoring in Kinesiology. Here''s a pic of me on campus. [IMAGE]'

  user_input: So you can recognize me, here's a good close-up shot. [IMAGE] I have
    long red hair, which is almost always tied back. And I never take this worn leather
    bracelet off; my father, David, gave it to me for good luck.
  assistant_response: 'Thanks for the picture, Madison. I''ve noted your key visual
    features: long red hair and the significant leather bracelet from your father.'

  user_input: It's really important you understand my diet. I'm Madison Hayes, and
    it's super strict and all about performance. I eat a lot of grilled chicken and
    quinoa. I absolutely cannot stand heavy, greasy food like deep-dish pizza or fried
    chicken.
  assistant_response: Understood. A strict, performance-focused diet is a priority.
    I've noted your preference for foods like grilled chicken and your dislike for
    greasy food. I'll remember that.

  user_input: Another thing—I'm Madison Hayes, and I hate being inactive. I can't just
    sit still for long periods. Trying to make me watch a long, slow movie is basically
    torture for me.
  assistant_response: Noted. You have a strong dislike for inactivity, and you specifically
    mentioned that you hate sitting through long, slow movies. Got it.

  user_input: I should tell you about my doubles partner, Isabella Rossi—everyone
    calls her Izzy. Our dynamic is... complicated. [IMAGE] We're a powerful team,
    but we're also each other's main competition for the number one singles spot.
    The rivalry is intense.
  assistant_response: I see. A complex relationship with your teammate and rival,
    Izzy Rossi. Effective partners but also fierce competitors. I've recorded this
    dynamic.
  image_prompt: A dynamic photo of two female college tennis players, Madison Hayes
    (red hair) and Isabella 'Izzy' Rossi, on a tennis court during a doubles match.

  user_input: My head coach, Coach Miller, is a huge influence. He is relentlessly
    tough on me, but it's because he believes in my potential. Our training sessions
    are no joke. This was us today. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: Okay, I understand. Your relationship with Coach Miller is demanding
    but founded on his belief in your potential. I've noted his important role.
  image_prompt: A side-view photo on a tennis court. Coach Miller, a stern-looking
    man in his 50s, is speaking intensely to Madison Hayes. Madison is listening with

  user_input: When I'm training or doing my morning runs, I have to listen to high-energy
    electronic music. It's the only thing that gets me into the zone. [IMAGE]

    for training and getting in the zone. I've added that to your preferences.
  image_prompt: A first-person perspective shot from Madison Hayes's point of view
    while she is on a morning run along a park trail. We can see her athletic shoes

    Miller. Here's the final scoreboard. [IMAGE]

    into a heated argument over a bad line call during a doubles practice match. It's
    just making our rivalry even more strained.
  assistant_response: Okay, I've noted that. A recent argument with Izzy over a line
    call during practice has increased the on-court tension between you two.

  user_input: So the team went out for pizza and beer last night to celebrate a win.
    It was awful for me. I couldn't eat that greasy pizza, so I just sat there drinking
    water while everyone else partied. [IMAGE] Felt like a total outsider.
  assistant_response: I can see why that would be uncomfortable. You felt isolated
    at the team's pizza party because the food went against your strict diet. I've
    recorded this event.
  image_prompt: A photo taken from Madison Hayes's point-of-view at a loud pizza parlor.
    The table is covered with greasy pizzas and glasses of beer. Directly in front
    is just a single, plain glass of water. Teammates are visible in the background,
    laughing and eating.

  user_input: Just finished another brutal training session with Coach Miller. My
    ankle is paying the price for it. [IMAGE] Going to be icing this for a while.
  assistant_response: Ouch, that looks painful. I've noted that you're icing your
    ankle after a particularly grueling training session with Coach Miller. I hope
    it recovers quickly.
  image_prompt: A close-up photo of Madison Hayes's ankle propped up on a locker room
    bench. A professional-grade ice pack is tightly strapped around the ankle with
    velcro wraps.
