challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] Julian seems unusually agitated and impatient in the office this week, even for him. What two recent events could be contributing to his mood? The user must combine the frustration from his argument with Isabelle and the forced inactivity from his sprained wrist."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] You're a founder with a solid, stable, low-risk business plan that promises slow but steady growth. How would you need to frame your pitch to get Julian's attention? The user must recognize Julian's hatred for 'safe' ideas and suggest focusing on a hidden 'disruptive' angle or a potential for massive scaling, ignoring the safety aspect."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Given that Julian despises slow, formal events, why would he even agree to go to the hospital charity gala? The user must connect his long-term preference with his relationship to his sister, Elena, deducing she was the reason."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] If Isabelle were to go on a month-long vacation, what would likely happen to the firm's investment strategy during that time? The user must infer that without the 'brakes,' Julian would likely make several aggressive, high-risk investments."
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Describe the fundamental conflict of interest that led to the recent argument between Julian and Isabelle regarding the AI company. The user must use their core personalities—Julian's love of risk vs. Isabelle's caution—to explain the clash."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Julian's sister, Elena, wants to have a serious talk with him about his 'dangerous' lifestyle. What would be the worst way for her to approach this conversation, and what might be a better way? The user must understand that a slow, lecturing approach would fail, and a better way might be to frame it as a strategic problem or a risk-management issue to appeal to his mindset."
