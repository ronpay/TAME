  user_input: Hey, getting you up to speed on my professional life. I'm a Junior Marketing
    Analyst. My main goal right now is to really impress my manager, Jessica Chen.
    I want to show her I've got what it takes. Here's a shot of me at my desk, trying
    to look the part. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: Got it, Leo. You're a Junior Marketing Analyst focused on earning
    the approval of your manager, Jessica Chen. I've noted this. Thanks for the picture.
  image_prompt: A medium shot of Leo Vance, a male in his early 20s with neat brown
    hair and blue eyes, sitting at a pristine, organized office desk. He's wearing
    a crisp button-down shirt and tie, looking at the camera with a polite, slightly
    eager smile. A computer monitor with marketing analytics charts is visible in
    the background.

  user_input: 'Just so you have my food preferences down, I''m really big on structured,
    neat meals. I do meal prep every Sunday. Check out this week''s lunch setup: chicken,
    broccoli, and rice, perfectly portioned. [IMAGE] It''s how I stay efficient.'
  assistant_response: Okay, I've logged your preference for meticulously prepared
    and portioned meal-prep lunches, like chicken, broccoli, and rice. It looks very
    organized.
  image_prompt: A top-down photo of five identical, clear food containers arranged
    in a neat row. Each container holds perfectly separated portions of grilled chicken
    breast, steamed broccoli, and white rice. The photo is clean and minimalist.

  user_input: Ugh, one thing I absolutely cannot stand is the cheap, bitter coffee
    they have in the office kitchen. It's just sludge from a pot that's been sitting
    there for hours. [IMAGE] I'd rather have nothing.
  assistant_response: Noted. A strong dislike for cheap, bitter office coffee. I'll
    remember that.
  image_prompt: A close-up photo of a stained glass coffee pot on a warmer in a generic
    office breakroom. The coffee inside is dark and murky. A stack of styrofoam cups
    sits next to it. The lighting is sterile and uninviting.

  user_input: On a social note, I'm Leo Vance, and I'm not a fan of unstructured gatherings. Parties
    or get-togethers with no clear purpose just make me feel awkward and unproductive.
    I never know what to do.
  assistant_response: Understood. I've made a note that you dislike unstructured social
    events and feel awkward in those situations. Thanks for sharing.

  user_input: I wanted to tell you about my work friend, Samira Joshi. We just call
    her Sam. She's the one I talk to when I'm stressed about work. She's my reality
    check. This is us grabbing coffee this morning. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: Thanks, Leo. I've recorded that Samira 'Sam' Joshi is your close
    confidante and 'reality check' at the office.
  image_prompt: A candid photo of Leo Vance and a female colleague, Samira Joshi,
    standing in a modern office pantry. Leo looks earnest and is talking, while Sam
    has a slightly cynical, friendly smirk as she listens, holding a coffee mug. They
    seem like comfortable friends.

    video games are my go-to, and I absolutely love doing escape rooms with friends.

  user_input: I should probably warn you, I'm Leo Vance, and I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I get really
    stressed out when things don't go according to plan or when unexpected problems
    pop up. It throws my whole system off.
  assistant_response: Got it. You identify as a perfectionist and feel stressed by
    unplanned events or problems. I'll keep that in mind.

  user_input: Oh, and this is important. I always wear this smartwatch. [IMAGE] My
    parents gave it to me for my college graduation, so it means a lot. It's part
    of my daily uniform.
  assistant_response: I see. You always wear a sleek smartwatch that was a graduation
    gift from your parents. I've added this to your key appearance details.
  image_prompt: A close-up shot of Leo Vance's wrist. He is wearing a crisp, white
    shirt cuff and a sleek, modest smartwatch with a dark band. The watch face shows
    a simple, professional layout.

  user_input: This week was a nightmare. We had a major project launch, and a last-minute
    technical glitch sent everything sideways. I was so stressed trying to get it
    fixed. Here's a picture of my desk in the middle of the chaos. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: 'That sounds incredibly stressful. I''ve logged the event: a
    recent project launch was complicated by a technical glitch, causing you a lot
    of stress. Hope things are better now.'
  image_prompt: A photo of Leo Vance at his desk late at night, illuminated by his
    monitor. He has his hands on his head, looking at the screen with an expression
    of pure stress. His usually neat desk is slightly cluttered with coffee cups and
    scattered notes.

  user_input: The company holiday party was last week. To avoid all the awkward small
    talk, I volunteered to serve drinks at the bar all night. It gave me a specific
    role, which helped a lot. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: That's a clever strategy. I've recorded that at the recent company
    holiday party, you volunteered to serve drinks to have a defined role and avoid
    unstructured socializing.
  image_prompt: A photo of Leo Vance from behind a makeshift bar at an office party.
    He's wearing a button-down shirt and a slightly forced, polite smile as he hands
    a drink to a coworker. The background is filled with people mingling.

  user_input: We had a team-building lunch yesterday and it was a 'make your own messy
    nachos' bar. Honestly, it was my worst nightmare. So chaotic and greasy. I barely
    ate anything. Look at this mess. [IMAGE]
  assistant_response: 'I can see why that would be uncomfortable for you. I''ve noted
    the event: a team-building lunch with a messy, ''make your own nachos'' bar that
    you disliked due to the chaos and greasy food.'
  image_prompt: A first-person perspective photo looking down at a stainless-steel
    food bar. Various bowls are filled with nacho toppings like ground beef, liquid
    cheese, salsa, and jalapenos. Tongs and spoons are scattered haphazardly. It looks
    messy and chaotic.

  user_input: I had my review with Jessica, and she told me I need to be more 'assertive'
    with my own ideas. I'm Leo Vance, and I know she meant it to be helpful, but I've
    been worrying about it all day. It feels like a major criticism.
  assistant_response: I understand why that would be on your mind. I've recorded that
    your manager, Jessica, recently gave you feedback to be more assertive, and you've
    been feeling worried about it. Thanks for confiding this.
