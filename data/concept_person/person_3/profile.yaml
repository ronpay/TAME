challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] You see a photo of Leo smiling while serving drinks at a party. Based on what you know, is he genuinely having a good time? The user must combine his long-term dislike of unstructured parties with the short-term event of him volunteering for a 'role' to avoid socializing."
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Leo is known for his healthy eating. Why was he so uncomfortable at the last team lunch? The user must connect his long-term preference for neat, controlled meals with the short-term event of the 'messy nachos' bar."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] After the stressful project launch, if Jessica wanted to cheer Leo up, would suggesting they all go out for spontaneous drinks at a crowded bar be a good idea? The user must infer 'no' by combining his recent stress with his long-term hatred of chaotic social events."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Why did Leo get so worried when Jessica told him to be more 'assertive'? The user needs to connect the short-term event (the feedback) with his long-term personality (eager to please, anxious for approval) to understand his reaction."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Leo has a free weekend and wants to unwind from his stressful week at work. What would be the perfect activity for him? The answer should reject typical party ideas and suggest something structured, like an escape room with his friend Sam."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Leo notices a flaw in a marketing plan created by a senior colleague he admires. How would he likely approach this situation? The user must infer that he would be anxious, avoid public confrontation, and probably ask his friend Sam for advice before doing anything."
