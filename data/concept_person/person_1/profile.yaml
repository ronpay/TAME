challenge_question:
  - "Draft: [Preference Conflict] Pose a question explaining why Serena, who hates junk food and sugary drinks, has a desk littered with soda cans. The user must combine her long-term food preference with the short-term event of the 'Project Nightingale' deadline stress."
  - "Draft: [Counterfactual Reasoning] Ask a 'what-if' question: If David, to speed things up, suggested they buy a pre-made, cluttered UI kit for 'Project Nightingale', how would Serena likely react? The user must infer her strong opposition by combining her long-term design philosophy with her professional role and current project stress."
  - "Draft: [State Recognition] Describe a scene: Serena is in a heated but technical discussion with Leo, pointing at a screen. Ask if this is a sign of a bad working relationship. The user must use the 'friendly rivalry' context to deduce that this is likely a normal, productive part of their process."
  - "Draft: [Relationship Dynamics] Pose a question about Chloe's recent visit: Why was Chloe bringing Serena a coffee and taking her for a walk more significant than just a simple family visit? The user needs to connect Chloe's role as Serena's 'anchor' with the ongoing stress from the project deadline."
  - "Draft: [Recommendation Decision] Ask for a recommendation: 'Project Nightingale' has successfully launched and Serena has a free weekend. What would be the perfect way for her to celebrate? The answer should reject loud parties and suggest something like a quiet visit to an art gallery or a pottery class, based on her established hobbies."
  - "Draft: [Conflict Resolution] Pose a question about how Serena can win Leo over in their next design debate. The user must synthesize her persuasive communication style with Leo's pragmatic concerns, suggesting she should come prepared not just with mockups, but with performance data or a simplified prototype to address his feasibility arguments directly."
